Lastly, at times, the pictures comes out almost all white like it was taken with a light shining on the lens.","Camera Problems on Priv I don't know if its software or even a hardware issue, but I struggle to get an image to stabilize before shooting a photo. I have had phone for 6 months , dropped it a couple times, nothing crazy. But getting a clear,  image  to stabilize is now hard to get. If I don't find a solution, it will sadly mean a new phone.","Sometimes it takes amazing pictures and videos. Other times the camera makes a weird sound and there is a vibration then the screen goes blurry and the images look really bad and out of focus. It's really frustrating. Please help fix this problem.","the app disappointing in latest update frequently, after taking several clear pics, the screen and pics taken will be blurred (or shaky). i need to restart the mobile or wait for sometime to make it work again","Autofocus is COMPLETELY OFF For a while I've noticed that my pictures cannot focus so I'll hold the screen and it will be ok. But lately it's been worse. Standing for a few seconds and the camera just blurs out. I press the screen to focus, it will and moments later it will blur out. I was taking pictures of a birthday cake...so no fast movements and such. Once zoomed in at various events, the focus again gets blurreD. Is there be a proper fix??? This is sad to have a 18mp camera that doesn't work proper half the time.","Completely unsatisfied Terrible as it is I now have to use android on my BlackBerry, but this camera is so slow, can't focus on moving objects (I've taka lot of pictures some if cars going 50mph while I'm standing still and perfect pictures on other BlackBerryS) the quality is great for video.

This app is almost a replica of our website (http://answers.practicalaction.org) but with some neat features like Filtering using the subject area(s) (Agriculture, Livestock, Climate Change and many more), the ability to select your choice of document language, Favoring a document so that you can view it later, Downloading a document, Offline Browsing and so on. The best thing is that the app and its contents are free to use and it works very well on low bandwidth connections as well.","comments":["wonderful waow this is the best app ever in my experience,God bless you!","Productive!

BUT, im not sure if its because of carelessness or maybe the app creators arent native english speakers (i really dont mean this offensively) but some of the laws are hard to understand because of the way theyre worded/written. If we could just change the way some of them are worded so i know whats supposed to be said that would be great. Otherwise a great app","Too Many Adverts I see the creator of this app wishes to become rich overnight using the adverts that pop up every 10 seconds. Very annoying and distasteful too. Deleted app within 5 mins of downloading it.","Helpful summary if concepts. Only negative was that it did have grammatical errors.","Great information, but... I'm no grammar nazi, but you need an English major to go over these. Im sorry if im wrong but i feel like english isnt the first language of the writer. Good information, but somtimes rather hard to understand due to punctuation and sentence structure. As you can read i am no English major myself. Just a tip. Great app otherwise.","Wow I really need some thing like this to get rich , earn money and save my money , really awesome","Best summary to the original book.

My only disappointment is that I have most achievements but one won't pop. I need to do 20 tasks, and my stats show 46 complete but still nothing :(","Its definitely a time killer... only recommendation would be to stop the updates when you're playing pong. They pop up and take up the majority of the screen and make you lose concentration. Especially if you have a ton of them. Other than that, this game is pretty fun.","Developers, my tablet had a booth where it went back in time three years. This is one of my favorite mobile games. My workers will take 3 years to go back to normal. Please help. I really don't want to reset my game. I would really appreciate it if you could help fix this problem. I will do anything to get it back.","The graphics are throwback to 8-bit and music as well. Tap the screen to beg for coins and buy stuff and work your way up. Not too much action or story but it's a nice little fun way to pass the time.","update: made ultimate donation and now replaying to unlock all achievements.  This is the only game I've come across that I can play without restriction even though I can't afford to pay. If I run out of VC's I can watch a video or just keep tapping and wait for one to be thrown. I love the scratch card and wheel because I've been able to get lucky and upgrade faster playing them. Love the challenges that break up the standard gameplay as well. Personally I enjoy the fact that the game doesn't have ANY correlation to popularity meaning no having to spam requests to earn coins etc. Wanted to give you a review and encourage people to try this app if tap/tycoon games are your thing and you really can't or don't want to eventually pay real money.","Best time waster ever.

Could add northern hemisphere, forest, marsh and so on maps, a option to record, for alfa, have a male and female, not just one or the other, the mating, should have a person's real age in a bio or something, who knows if it's a pre-teen or teen your chatting with, and some people do get perverted when it comes to this sort of thing, adding friends would be great, you meet someone in a game and who knows when you can hunt or vs with them again. Thank you and keep up the good work.","It is limited and I wish to see better scaling between a tank and dps or healer at low levels. I enjoy the concept and will continue to play until more development from the map or maps to the size of maps and seeing if they will do cold climate game to hunt or even class bonus for sneaking up on enemies. Theres alot of ideas to be  worked on. Ill happily play as it grows. Thanks","It's great, but this has so much potential that I'm going to be critical. I'd really like the wolves to be able to jump, roll over, sleep, play and interact more with others- running is fun, but wolves do more than run and eat. The noises only have about 3 variations, more of a soundtrack would be nice. What could also make it better is having like a guild, or a clan, where there are pups, apprentices, warriors, elders, a deputy and a leader. The ability to talk privately or in groups would be awesome, as well as a bigger map with different environments to cater for the different pelts. I really hope the developers add these things because it would keep many coming back to play :)","ALL WOLF LOVERS DOWNLOAD NOW. This is AMAZING! I love it so much. Maybe if there could be a male and female alpha of the pack, which should be the ones who fight the most. And to let people know that they are alpha, they should have a paw sign floating above them. And maybe u can name ur pack, and claim a cave or under a tree for a base for resting when ur health is low. BUT ITS AMAZING! All ur games are amazing, keep up great work💖","It's a great game....with good graphics...and I already tried to get my dad to play it.....definitely a recommendable game...  But..  I Would appreciate it if you could add:      ▪being able to have a pup with another wolf     ▪a chat...so that its possible to establish a pack among the other players   ▪and if I may ask, that you be able to have it so people can friend you...and you can see when they are active..    ▪and please...please...make your game invulnerable to hackers....so that everyone has a fair chance when playing....  I know it's a bit much....but please try to add one or a few of these suggestions......   Thank you...    Signed,    Wolf villena","It's ok... lots of grind before you can wander away from the starting area... then just the same... lots of grind to have a chance against the bigger or more fierce animals... Very nice gfx and simple to control, though the screen turning could do with some changes to make it more fluid and easier to adjust."],"version":"1.1","updated":"February 7, 2017","appId":"com.swiftappskom.thewolfrpg","minInstalls":500000,"genre":"Role Playing","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swiftappskom.thewolfrpg&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.swiftappskom.thewolfrpg/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.swiftappskom.thewolfrpg/similar"},{"preregister":false,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BM0eHJd5v34","maxInstalls":5000000,"developerEmail":"onlinegames.support@gameloft.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/GkavchvSRzw10DXyE9vi8id-s1ZGNe05nv11guqja9GUL-wB3pzA3dLV3MCYDHw1cAVx=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/A48ITOoMF-aoA-MpmBSGDcOuqMHGXDFhrFlcU0y2dYrfVXv-nyP6zr6wzQO_E1iGMQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/StFUfDX6wTGj420ux4nkycdVzRA0DZg7wfYcVCE81cFovg64Zv12XfDff7k8hW4smWsw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/XKq42LCC1OMBq5OCNoz6CCYqStSucJ2Yvy-oqlyOzluYFQgTVr7i-2cINIyHGs_hPw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/uGK4psLEUuUjh1jJTWMkJ-rgqciaAslAuO_uHRopJNWOOZU60GbUimMeRm41o490qjc=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/MIpbAUIy4wZ9LUqE8XRHb81Do5N1TObFO_6LPds7zCJfC_NZHftKok2UMhrRfs3g0w=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/KRq8XRNKbZbn27O6zR26g64pj8qrCuLkLqJpRS4EuxuS08_ROhdlYnYpJsWgf0JmCf0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lDj0byaB7v0M8ppg0gW4juqBTSbtyPOSA-5QArLCcNbqqfKLitYrR_rYhyjXYhMbsLe=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/m1x1YHIv_tTmZJ_sMc5d-5Cb5hyRw1Oo5i_r5oS6WLXdmO3sOz42pcxagyLxn4xpHpE=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pnYYh_bt1-9iPjN8sXmsFm0Scqa1txiw3vfajg5w6TsOj2tc4B2gP-jS778zWvt5-ec=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/eMNJmCsuf8Srb6uAWkQjClHZS4nDR6CvcTL15tH5GvRotzU5DIl9eY8UNVnJZ39DKerS=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/n8m-U2-PCop-ag17l1nLNZFBEwDOVM7NhVx0jwaDqR5lkEl2T8gJPkXEcUdLqELqvw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/VKFV0tbuyTQoBGX32naozkzCTgumjrx9LyAWdy8bfHVDE2LimQtqnlOBPDfiPFQTQQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jx5EQ5xEOPsuY4Wn175c-ivQKz8Q61SnfDYJDznj16CuliMDSE5zULo7Jy4k0iQtSQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/gvwZXcYNLRnSKAkjWyEgqABrWTyl3K3od1BvFfFut5bYjfgxqhW1bD8uiYNcGPqvyw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CQItgk56sV9Ap5tOXAQwOfL39e8nuhksH67NX90eOXWuh8BJ1sQfYr351XjitwUjYA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_t15d09fM4RAVh6xyExzvdS3VJJe0K20qROfITXDnbEUygvxPFeolg0E3_Pj4j_Esk=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/hUCuU1USSrujM59HK_jFxfunHG8PRyuVBaezS4pvlPyWZVvqlXD8GhDRi_ssIljqAw=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3","contentRating":"Teen","descriptionHTML":"Join thousands of players and enjoy the best MMORPG experience on Android: Team up with your friends to take on quests and explore our vast fantasy world, achieve heroic feats and lead your guild to the top of the multiplayer leaderboard.<br><br>==== IMPORTANT NOTICE====<br>Order &amp; Chaos Online delivers the best experience on powerful devices.

I have hardly any lag, if any on 4G. The graphics are stunning. Incredibly smooth gameplay. And it has a healer class (unlike O&C 2), which is completely amazing. There is no form of stamina (otherwise known as vigor in O&C 2) at all so you can play all day long. It feels like a PC game, honestly rivals WoW and LOTRO in my own opinion. Exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!","Do you not speak English or do you not like $?  If this were my product, i would fire everyone who thought this was a good idea.  Generic responses like \"we revamped talent tree\" and \"fixed the monk\" are exactly what we don't want to hear.  And stop ignoring us!  TO NEW PLAYERS..THIS RECENT UPDATE IS THE DEATH OF THIS GAME.  Fix the talent tree now.  Fire whoever created this patch and this game may survive.  And respond to me for f*cks sake.","Easily my all time favorite go to game, I tried the 2nd and would rather invest in this one,  the 1st. Just like WoW and it's free! While I've invested a tiny amount of cash on this game, my 3 lvl 60 characters are free to lvl to 70 (now 75?), find / equip gear and upgrade it! All free, from lotteries and other time based mechanics.   On the Talent screen, 2nd to last column, lvl 65, has half the pop up window skill description is cut off. Still cut off. ..uninstall reinstall...","Grate game...but it has a lot of lag now at new world boss everyone lags sooo bad..that u dont get any loot... ive done it 3 times and got loot 1 time BUT.... it just needs new scanner weapons because there's new higher bosses and. Gear..but scanners to low..and the Legendary craft's i cant find im. 600 crafting and.waiting on info on. New craft's located at..?","I LOVE quest based MMORPG games. I started playing them a long time ago. This satisfies all my cravings for that type of game AND allows me to play on my tablet. If you like that type of game, give this a shot. You won't be disappointed!","Fun to play. I enjoy myself but for some reason I can't log on to one of my 2 characters.  It keeps kicking me off but I can still log on to my other one. Same account.

The whole thing is really good, but it runs too slowly on a 4core, 1GB RAM tablet, where many 3D games run fine, even with bloom.  Please add graphics details options and try to optimize the game, make it faster.  Also, the pink stones or whatever they are look really silly and ruin the immersion effect.  Stone must look like stone, though may look somewhat more special so that I know that I can 'pick it up'.  Also, I did not find any other material than 'fiber', no stone or metal.  On the map my heading must be shown - the direction that I'm facing/going.  A compass is needed on the HUD, and better yet, make a translucent map on the HUD, small or full screen when needed.  Until then, I can't say any more, will be looking at this in the future. Thanks.","Fantasic game Love this game dont get why it hasn't got a higher rating id like to see some stuff added but the game is very nice one hint watch free adds for credits before you leave the base then you can craft a wepon to defend yourself sharks in water lol id like to see more fish and more things to do and maby be a little easier to level up and alot more options for building stuff other than that grate game love it","Love hate I don't know what everybody is talking about it doesn't take but one minute to download the graphics are great and what do you mean not like the real subnautica this game is it's on the game and not based off of subnautica unless you can find and actually show me some evidence I don't believe any of you","It's a great underwater survival game idea. Good graphics and all. Just minor bugs that need fixed. Such as moving around. Plus I understand the fact that it's a free game. But you really don't need to put in ads every two minutes.","Coin earning Doesn't pay out. Ive watched an ad twice now with not a single coin being given to me for it. Thats a huge rip off.

I say that because you can play rock music with it....but I think you could pull off some punk music too. No other genres can be played...it is not allowed by the One. I have studied guitar and all instruments with the Sages of Yanthysmere, which is in the mountain country, beyond the river boundary. They have taught me many things. Now I will teach you. The Sages would prefer it if THE BLUE CIRCLE for Tab Tracker, which appears in the bottom right of the screen, was elsewhere. So as not to cover up the valuable guitar tab, which young seekers have worked so hard to bring us. Place it (or it's features) in the menu bar at the top of the screen instead. The Sages will grant you an extension of blessings.","This app used to be my favorite app for keeping all of my sheet music when I wanted to play my guitar. Since the new update, it has turned to crap. They are constantly adding pro tabs to my favorites even though I cant access them. It also now has an autofit feature which cuts off alot of chords. They have made it way more difficult and frustrating to just sit down and play music.","Good app but WAY too much advertising. I paid the $3, and now I see ads for the $10 upgrade when I open the app, there's an upgrade notification I can't clear, so the app icon always has the number one on it, and now they've automatically added the \"pro\" version of each of my favorite tabs which requires me to buy the upgrade if I accidentally click on it. So now I have to go through and remove the pro versions that they've added. If I want the upgrade I know where to find it. Your annoying advertising makes me want to never purchase your upgrade. The auto scroll feature is cool.","No more attempts to up sell after already purchasing the extras!! I am really enjoying the app now.  Update: This has been fixed and I can't praise the app enough now. It isn't just useful, but part of my everyday learning.","I like this app on my phone but I recently moved my guitar stuff to a bigger area in the house with my computer. When I try to sign into computer version it wants me to pay for tab pro all over again. I purchased premium on here since I've used the app but I don't want to pay monthly or yearly on pc for something I paid for on here. I don't know if that is a sync issue but whatever it is, please fix it.","New update erased all of my favorites.

It gets extremely frustrating when I have to say something 5+ times before it understands. I'm a native English speaker! That coupled with how hot it runs, and when it gets hot the lag is enormous. It's bad enough having to repeat things, but having to wait up to 10 seconds after saying a word only to find that it doesn't understand! Enough to frustrate you to want to quit. The concept is great, but having to just watch things happen cause all I can do is skip is not fun. I have other Daydream VR games that don't have the heat and lag problem, and they have much more things going on in them. Needs some major updating to make this 4 or 5 stars.  Edit: additionally, I just was on the ground and wanted to leave and I wasn't able to go up into the sky. Had to completely shut down the game to escape","I stopped using it after saying 'grow icecream'.

NO!!! This is the game that lets u and ur friend to, enjoy all the time, it also is very addictive and plus the servers r AWESOME. Thx mojang u really did what was impossible, and keep up the updates were all here for ur team :)","Minecraft has become such a stupid game recently and I'm sorry but I had to pay to change my gamertag thats ridiculous absolutely ridiculous before I could just go on to settings and change it with no complication. Other than that minecraft is a great game I love it and I sit and would play it for hours.","This is a great game however when I try to play online it Just stops and goes black. Any suggestions.    I'm still giveing it five stars because it is overall a great game. Its just the multiplayer that I have problems. Please give me suggestions on how to fix this problem.","Please fix some bugs that causes the game to crash. (I'm a samsung user and i use wired android gamepad). When it crash, it doesnt save properly and It ruins the survival mode. Will give 5 star if fixed.","A really good game, I really enjoy it the graphics are great. Its definitely worth paying £4.99 and I would recommend to all. I love the new minecraft music, it really makes the game feel almost real. I hope that soon you will add more features like woodland mansions, lamas and armor stands. One thing that puts the game down is having to have an Xbox live account to have or join a realm. I would love it if you changed that feature. Me and my friends are always playing minecraft and we are very greatfull for all your hard work towards the game.

It is fun, great use of the bleach story, awesomely cut. The problem is more with loading the game, I downloaded the game quick, which I found surprising and then spent an hour and a half downloading further content... I could forgive this but!! I still have to be online to play the game... Not sure why. Please introduce offline playing. Also, every time I come away from the app, when I go back it has to load all over again. Fix these 2 and I'll give 5 stars.","This game has been by far the most I have ever had on a mobile phone. I have just gone past 200 days playtime and still enjoy it immensly. KLab have created a great community around this game and are constantly adding new content and are rewarding players enough resources to keep playing for free. It is a great game model and have recommended it to many friends since. Be they bleach fans or not, the combat looks great and is fun while staying challenging when doing raids and other end game content. Nightmare mode certainly is a challenge when it comes around. Well done KLab.","Not a super Bleach fan, but I do enjoy the anime (not those damn filler tho). Anyway, I like how they have the character pack (monthly) because if a person can't get it through normal summon, they can get it from there. It's a win win situation, and it's not p2w just because someone decided to purchase it. A f2p van archive the same as a p2w through hard work and luck. Keep up the great work.","Overall its a good game, however there's a few minor and one major issue with the game.   Controls for the most part are great. Expect when trying to use one of you special moves, and it registers ultimate.  Game play is good.  Nothing to complian about.  Summons is where the major issues are. Now i understand its random, but it gets old rather quick pulling the exact same characters over again. For the most part recently and before now that's all i get same pull. I have gotten lucky and gotten a gew decent summons. But its disappointing getting the same stuff. Though you gain large exp crystal. It sucks. I've been after 5 star unohana since i started. No luck. So summons desperately needs to be fixed","Best mobile game I've played. Constantly updating the game in terms of event, features and characters. Very generous when it comes to earning in game currency. It doesn't feel like it wants my wallet like other mobile games. More games need to follow KLabs as an example of how to make a great game!","Overall good game but there is somethig i'd like to point out: 1. Characters 1-4 stars cannot be evolved once maxxed they stay like this so it is meaningless to develop them 2.my 6 stars ukitake with maxxed soul tree currently level 90 is weaker than he was at 5 stars level 80 with maxxed skill tree. 3.special skills on 6 star characters cost too much for the benefits that you can get from them. Overall good game but it needs improvement"],"version":"4.1.1","updated":"January 27, 2017","appId":"com.klab.bleach","minInstalls":1000000,"genre":"Action","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.klab.bleach&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.klab.bleach/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.klab.bleach/similar"},{"preregister":false,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kayXwLI36sA","maxInstalls":50000000,"developerEmail":"support+android@noodlecake.com","screenshots":["//lh4.ggpht.com/ywZooAhRJrebBt0elakiHlAtsl3kCKoVxpG02EgMsmRRxjEYexeu7Q7PGUTK87DtnLGC=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/a17w5vY1loZ0afKOJg_6ViAPHKD5cUCOlWbMoZbR_DvZ5IbxmApU53z9j1M1A2849KnC=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/MJbdtQX_TJ6xmUBKI9qmQOxHkk7eUp12kJAiiZ9v0ht9lJb6HmDm7LrWtFTuarf_4Q=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/xse4dFxh1epYEo22y2cpUqT6KZTETBqhwLefWc5KVQammBr0qoAJMBBCgHxnK7cuoHxs=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/UelWVTrtKzYC1JaQYkkyA7YsZxKsFTZyKjA7Ol4WapVxWrYFC1gjhoIEDCW2XIf3gzw=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/lkGL-sUiGqxtqolm7X1yrGvAfJ3JZa-4CxzlsFkaL5ChQSswyZII90c6regT--MQqMo=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/mEbe14Xmx2UhZ8uOfdwTjLbVVEkuKhXPW2_a9c7TwatdFDk2-fBkWRWGhcRXman9uw=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/MYbmw7o6pG90SjskuOg--Go14Z0H3IR_uHSx3sM83XzQDkx4P9ajndUdxu6fugoBTPw=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/pBATUbonXl0ss35b6MZwRWdvMOIY8w56ZwnH3UKT1aw85S9vNmSPk2ip25U0kJNTv71Y=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/hm6SNlriGhum9dAx4f3LTma16ksBus7Pq1j_GCFY20dY4CFdMU4lE4Qnagn5dp5ZJA=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/yJM3gCitk6DCklC0lwZrGDPFhzEqF31IqDz1CKAf6YngyYK2JmVC6PYUUOCP5pQdAt3z=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/e4AchgAB8aoJBQW60WCDobYB5b2iMVxaAz1uA10tmIH8ZM7kG-XcnBumJjOseai7IZ0=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/j3HmtDuNVphDGtVLTHU0ijFe8yWXs3bQn0BkcGp_-IBiMe7P4zWIc11ieu87yFnCvCT8=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/4Xf3EMc-ZNPFruPoBHTjyBEAxjMCnIqsQyOlE0qF1UQoACn_Ns0iokk81rSG7mt5-AQ=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/9VWcfNbensAaxZLtgXMjDC7bXhGThPFGmQc9yJCyiQakOpFfvnvoUX2DpFL1Ltj0c5s=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3.3","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Meet a happy jelly blob who dreams of soaring through the skies! <br><br>Help our friendly dessert reach new heights in this action packed game.

Then about a month ago I was looking though Google play store and found this again and ugh it's just so adorable. Maybe this is a game meant for small children bit I'm 13 and still play this because you only live once 😊... oh the flies need to go please","Great overall... One bug to report: When I open the app, it closes immediately! :( Plz include more characters and a fortnight update so it won't close automatically forever!! Hmm... Maybe monthly update. And a save file so I don't lose progress. And maybe some achievements so this game isn't that aimless?","I had an older version on my previous phone, but forgot to reinstall on this one.  Flash forward almost a year, I was looking through my old phone and decided I wanted to play this again.  MAN has this improved!  It is do much fun and so addicting!  My only wish is that there was an offline mode so I could play on the go without spending data.","Won\"t open Was really enjoying this game but lately it won't open. I tap on the icon, the screen goes black and then just goes back to my home page. I've tried turning my phone off and on and opening the game from the play store but nothing works. Very annoyed.","Ads I've had this app for years and the whole family loves it, but now they have racy ads at the bottom. For real?!  This is one of the most imminent games out there and I can't let my littles play it. Please change this.","Act of violence To be honest, this game completely ruined my life. The gameplay is complete crap. The phone tilting mechanics are so unoriginal and bias. The main plot to the game is vain and confusing. The game could use a much better story writer, and graphic designer. Overall, needs much improvement."],"version":"1.11.1","updated":"December 21, 2015","appId":"com.noodlecake.happyjump","minInstalls":10000000,"genre":"Arcade","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.happyjump&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.noodlecake.happyjump/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.noodlecake.happyjump/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":50000000,"developerEmail":"tikl.mobi@gmail.com","screenshots":["//lh6.ggpht.com/1dMAvaVpK0IPug-rhFzqcZg_IwuDYPdckpIwSUgowpB47GEjsiRorX6GSKFygYV9mg=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/Rhd7o3Xli0sWAco5WivpkhR4P0aDp1oXMU_ZksVJ5NRk_VBpOnjDZioJBNvmdNEdQhE=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/az6_7vGeVZbapMgY0ZEEh0Pyd4p4QJKsuer8U7pfKK5WtuPKvtPNOUJETPKTNybetBM=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/IL-Ns6Q4M1gwwBRQyAVA_r6QkAy2hMsfSeH6Lkg2xIvisjtayIZFxbBb8JPZX8M4HqSr=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/Qm08PhaeeoYqayhd4nKorCFZGif-Ar68Q2ej62xYiYDZFaoYlBc-lBV5Tj9LKjLphqI=h310"],"androidVersion":"1.5","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"&#x2605; Over 25 million users worldwide and counting<br>&#x2605; Named &quot;Top Developer&quot; by Google.<br>&#x2605; Featured in the book &quot;Amazing Android Apps for Dummies&quot;<br>&#x2605; Top communication/social app for years<br>&#x2605;&#xA0;Completely FREE.

What good is it if I am busy doing other stuff on my phone and someone tries to message me I won't even know because it doesn't come through unless the talk app it up with window, which how am I or the other party supposed to know when they are contacting me? Thought it would be like the most popular nextel two way. Any advice on settings so that I can fix this flaw?","I've had Tikl on several phones over the past 5 years or so. It's still fairly handy, as a 2 way, or as a voice messaging service. On the down side, nothing really new or innovative has been added and it seems like noone really is supporting it now. I'd like to see the option (or a easy way) to leave a video message. That would provide more satisfaction. One last note: reliability has also suffered, relating to voice messages, over the past year...","it's 2016 and its still the best After testing every messaging app including the new bbm,there is nothing better than Tikl.the speed is fast and the walkie talkie is instant unlike all the other talk send apps.with Tikl you get the best of both worlds.you got the Nextel network style calls which I miss and you get all the cool messaging functions that you get from every other messaging app but with a better simpler interface.I just wish the developer with stop worrying about Talkray and whatever other apps he is developing","Error after error Firstly my sim does not a number programed into it, then app suggests using facebook. That doesnt work either. Error in development. Two closed doors in my face, I uninstall.","Better than OK But not 5 star because author decided to annoy us with ads in lieu of having an ad free paid version. Bummer!","Facebook support?

Every car should be able to be purchased with cash or coin, no exceptions. Especially when you make them necessary to complete given tasks. They should also be attainable on a reasonably given timeline. A heads up on what to expect next for purchase is recommended  as well. Thank you for your time and decently thought out gaming experience.","Makes you watch adds! The game lets you speed up wait time by watching a 30 second add. The problem is the adds don't play. So its a useless futile loop. Somtimes they play sometimes \"video advert not available\" it's time consuming and frustrating. Game play itself is very basic. The only redeeming feature is the detail and selection of cars.","Fun but NOT COOL This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but I just signed in on a new phone and it won't let me play unless I give it access to my Contacts, Location and Telephone. For what kind of invasive reason does a racing game need these permissions!?","Very good but I have 2 improvements I absolutely love this game but it takes waaaaaay too long to refill fuel. If only it took like 2 mins or something for one gas.  Also if every time you level up you get a gas refill like other games.  If other people agree just say so.

Also the free gold scams you into getting a waste of space game for nothing.DO NOT use the free gold option. Tapjoy tricks you into installing an app or purchasing something, and when u email them for free gold missing they do not respond. All the cars shown in the pics before you get the app need a ton of gold btw.","Favorite Game on phone This is my favorite game on my phone mainly because I love classic cars and racing games but I wish the game had realistic car sounds and the sounds changed as you restored the car.

But I really hope they stop blocking you from proceeding to next episode, there are not enough people playing the game to get help unlocking, it's so pointless anyway! Can't I just watch a video ad? I'm not gonna mug myself off spending my hard earned on that once I run out if the free gold, get a grip.","Excellent game. But some levels are unattainable. Esp level 605, 618, 619. Glad 580 was fixed. So very difficult. Level 621 and 630  are impossible levels. I think the techs are smoking socks","This has crashed on me for at least a month or two. If it doesn't come back, I will uninstall it.

I've been playing this for months, and I've made a lot of Progress. I've put tons of time into Trials, thankfully haven't spent any real money, and progressed all the way to the point where you unlock your first Tier 3 tracks. Only, this new update came out, and I enjoyed it for a day or two, when suddenly I open the game and I'M BACK AT THE START! Nothing I do let's me turn my progress back to the point where it was. This is truly a great game, but I refuse to replay the whole think because of a glitch.","The game itself is brilliant but everything that surrounds the game is infuriating. Constant connection issues, have to force close and log in each time, lose challenges because of lost connection, not to mention I clearly cross the line ahead of the other racer and somehow still lose the race. This game makes me want to throw my phone at the wall. I would delete it but the game itself is too damn good. This game was forged in hell by Satan Himself.","Freezes up when I go to accept the \"Byte Sized Memory\" quest. And the fuel thing is kinda a pain. Also so is the reward gain vs cost of upgrades to the bikes. But I'm still having 'some' fun with it. Edit: keeps not logging me in either. I am on WiFi and connection shouldn't be a problem. Starting to hate it. EDIT 2: Apparently uninstalling and reinstalling the game fixed my broken quest problem.","Loses appeal fast. Many glitches now. Can't spin the prize spinner anymore so no way to get those new tracks. Still a tedious grind through some missions and others require even more grinding to level up your bike. Not a patch on the proper versions of trials which I love incidentally.","2 questions 1. I'm playing the game on two devices, logged in under the same name. Both devices have different game data now(like gems, money, tracks open etc) can this be fixed?   2. The new challenge isn't communicating with my track scores. I'll beat my record by 2 sec but I don't move up on the ranking. Can this be fixed?","Bottom line, it doesn't matter if it's any good, everything gets washed away by bad customer service and shadyness. I've downloaded two games and completed a survey and received nothing. I emailed them and sent them screenshots and they're like well actually you've already received your gems. Yeah. No I did not. I'd like to see some screenshots on what exactly I spent over 50 imaginary gems on. They're basically a bunch of liars who will give you the runaround and act like you're crazy because they are right and you are wrong. They're all talk and no action."],"updated":"January 10, 2017","appId":"com.ubisoft.redlynx.trialsfrontier.ggp","minInstalls":10000000,"genre":"Racing","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.redlynx.trialsfrontier.ggp&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.ubisoft.redlynx.trialsfrontier.ggp/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.ubisoft.redlynx.trialsfrontier.ggp/similar"}]}},{"name":"Good Health and Well-being","milestones":[{"description":"By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births ","progress":50},{"description":"By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births ","progress":92},{"description":"By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases","progress":41},{"description":"By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being ","progress":16},{"description":"Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol","progress":87},{"description":"By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents ","progress":40},{"description":"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes","progress":22},{"description":"Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all ","progress":3},{"description":"By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination ","progress":45},{"description":"Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate ","progress":30},{"description":"Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and non-communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect public health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all ","progress":70},{"description":"Substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training and retention of the health workforce in developing countries, especially in least developed countries and small island developing States ","progress":76},{"description":"Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks","progress":71}],"playstore":{"results":[{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":500000000,"developerEmail":"shealth.info@samsung.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/nKkGoVGBeKRtnCHI1ONOwnU2z39hXAXAxCoMG_5VHAN6GRf_yi2J2jB7aZFuyT2cqyE=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P9a_4dt94Bjef4hgzfIBS4fTbeWFVFwz9fpPBQYpPG0HxeueY-pMNQbnAM0lalmlrMg=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/m2NxOlBU6Nc7zjrA_jD_9xLA4MYN4FZiBDVX5sOytIvYYqvIC4e9-us4cnmsHW0dKd-Z=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZZZcR3JJDV0xf-YpnliXY3T9CVbfHSGNcwItk277HjalOoqfjoYvfks_mJS0d1SMFw=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.4","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"S Health provides core features to keep up your body fit and healthy.

I do wish the weekly summary still included the net gain/lose number for calories, and am patiently waiting for a scanner to be added for bar codes. It would make tracking food so much easier.  Any chance those things are coming back and/or being added soon?","I love this app!  I like to see how many steps I can reach in a day. Plus It keeps track of my walking and the calories I burn it's so cool to see all the information and it's all in one place. The only thing I can't seem to change is the daily goal steps. I want to move it up...Idk if I'm over looking it or if it's not an opinion that would be helpful to add if it's not.  Other than that I love S Health!","Hi Support, I love the pedometer but it stopped counting my steps after I dropped my phone. I have a Samsung Alpha Galaxy. The phone only fell 3 feet, was in a case, and otherwise was fine. Is there any way to recalibrate the pedometer to start getting an accurate step count again? I already tried restarting the phone and updating the app to the latest version, but that didn't work. It's still not counting steps properly.","I love this app, I have it along with the gear fit 2 and it's amazing! It's user friendly and easy to track your progress with. I would love to see one option become available though. I work nightshift and get all my steps in between 7pm and 7am and it gets frustrating when my day is split in half! Or combined with my \"next day\"! I'd love to be able to change when the new day starts, when my steps reset!","This had been my favourite fitness tracking app since I use gear s2 and samsung note 4. However, now that I am using gear s2 and xiaomi redmi note 4, the app does not seem to be able to capture the gps data from gear s2 and plot my running track into the map. It was working perfectly in my samsung note 4 but now I could not figure out how to make this work in xiaomi redmi note 4. Other data such as running distance, steps taken, etc are from gear s2 are captured correctly by the app.","Great App when you have a Gear Fit 2. However I would love to see the following improvements in the future. 1. There should be easy sync to Google fit app as a lot of app still do not have syncing with S Health option  2.

Overall, I've found this version to be pretty easy to use. Definitely easier than a previous version I used. I love the fact that it helps you track \"wellness\" and not just weight. 3 point to consider in updates: 1. Adding notes is helpful because I can put data I'm entering in context if needed. Right now, I do this in a separate place 2.  Pedometer would be great addition (currently use samsung's native app). 3. Wish the \"water tracking\" had visual/sound effects. Could increase effectiveness. Thnx!","Th e app is easy to use. It crashes a lot on me though. Would be nice if it also integrated with not just fitbit but Jawbone UP24 as well. The other thing I'd like to see is the ability to create a meal from ingredients so you don't have to keep re-entering it over and over if it's something you eat often.","Not sure what is going on with this app! Keeps telling me my login request fails even though I am entering the correct info. I've clicked forgot my password and then change it and it will work a couple of times but then can't login.  Just started doing this a couple of days ago. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!","Hard to use Logging your food is hard a lot of the time is says can't find something.  I connected my fitbit and it won't transfer the data unless I disconnect and reconnect. Very annoying. I've used multiple food diaries before and they are much easier to use than this one. I also hate how it rounds your measurements,  not the best for keeping the most accurate results.","It's a decent food tracker, especially since all the medifast meals are already programed into it. However it crashes a lot! More than have the time when I try to open app to add a meal it crashes and I have to go back in. But my biggest beef with the app is it's basically worthless as a weight/measurements tracker. It doesn't let you to enter in decimals at all so you're stuck trying to decide to which whole pound (or whole inch for the measurements) to round. It's utterly ridiculous.","Needs work I have the Amazon Fire Phone. I have been using the app for two days. I would have thought it would have refreshed itself and stayed fresh the next day. I was inputting today's food information but it added it to the previous day's total. I tried to edit, but it's still giving me difficulties and not syncing correctly. It doesn't sync well with the Dashboard webpage either. The dates are all smooshed together on the graphs. Landscape view doesn't work. I will see if they have the app for the iPad."],"version":"1.0.3","updated":"February 17, 2015","appId":"com.dstsystems.medifast.tsfl","minInstalls":10000,"genre":"Health & Fitness","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dstsystems.medifast.tsfl&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.dstsystems.medifast.tsfl/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.dstsystems.medifast.tsfl/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":50000,"developerEmail":"mnagdeve@gmail.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/DYSj-uY1KsSwjh_3baSimO31q02x8f2zRNv6ZXwqD6qYaUiVG8O8JvNnjTX0tM-3xEQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/x3piS-tUV2RhB14bNCaayug0ESUgFhmQuyxPpaPTBQNV1Dm01Mvyojq_v3125um_JIU=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PlWLery2Rhc8fIACbVK3nLy1lROZqxU6CoqF5p71ORB_QfE2hH0cTr-kE8KtQcmtyw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/viLkGD2yQD2jNPpVI6VY1Z1TEMz_SC22mYqk4GlLs4VreXKn728Lx1V9UclKIB-wtg=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.0.3","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"This app is your guide to fitness, good health, weight loss, diet-plan, nutrition, and remedies for diseases such as hypertension, anxiety, allergy, insomnia and many more.<br><br>Good health is quintessential for happy living and with this app you can access the info anywhere you go.

Oil list has good & useful info & further information links.        One person complained it linked to doTERRA. A person connected to doTERRA created it & the essential oils & oil blends listed are doTERRA.  The info can be used by anyone just know not all essential oils are consumable & not all brands are equal & labeled safe for consumption.  The app is great I think & I use it a lot.","Very Helpful Information! Great information presented in a very systematic way. Have recommended it to many friends and they use it all the time. As with all products moderate use is always a good thing. Shouldn't have side effects. If not comfortable, then don't consume internally! There are plenty of aromatic and topical benefits!","Not accurate Many of the oils listed for certain ailments were not accurate. Also, I believe DoTerra is a great company with that said, you can't call out other \"name\" companies for not being pure when you have no evidence of that fact or DoTerra for that matter. You really should leave that part out to be completely fair.","Not bad... compared to other apps! I have downloaded multiple oils lately.... This is the only one still installed! I don't even use doTERRA but it is very useful for other brands also. Yl apps are useless compared to this one.😉 and I'm a young living user!!  Good job makers of this app","Misleading The term 'therapeutic grade' has no meaning when it comes to essential oils and is merely a marketing term. Also this ap recommends internal use of oils which is irresponsible, dangerous, and getting close to practicing medicine without a license.  These MLM folks are underestimating the incredible power of high quality essential oils. There are growing numbers of reports of people experiencing serious medical problems from internal use of oils.","Good guide but I love having a quick reference but have to caution that this is a Young Living minion. The lie about certified oils is spewed in this. Note it's a copyrighted term by them. No validity at all to that.

But now it looks much different, and focus seems to be shifted from the purpose (to help you track calorie intake, etc) and shifted to social media. This makes everything take forever to load and the most useful section of the app (food/exercise logger) became super buggy where it should be the strongest.  I don't care about a food camp, I just want to track my calories and exercise. Uninstalling.","Supportive Used for a week so far, and the only glitch I have seen, is that I someti.es have to hit analysis twice to get it to properly refresh. Speaking of which, the analysis log is my favorite tool. It let's me see the full breakdown of +- calories, nutrition and vitamins. The very best part is the grading scale. It gives each food a grade and also gives you an overall grade for how you did that day. I am competitive, so it forces me to strive for the A rank. It helps keep me motivated and focused.","Great app I love how I can keep up with my nutrition. Two things I think should be added are a long term chart where you can see your nutrition by the week or the month. I go through each day and mark everything on a piece of paper in order to find any trends for nutrients I get too much of or not enough. I also noticed there is no sugars on the analysis chart. I think this should be added. I found another app that tracks your sugar so do not use this one much. I love how I can track my water too. Other app doesn't.","Perfect Unobtrusive ads. Turn off the social interaction piece. Nothing fancy. Download the scanner and scan what you eat.  Huge database with most store brands included. OK so it is missing some features, who cares?  It doesn't ask for your credit card or even your address. Best free app I ever used as far as intruding on my privacy goes.","Excellent database I am a diabetic looking for an app to help me track my carb intake. I've found the food database to be excellent. This app's activity log is very good but could be improved to include a pedometer or allow the user to enter steps for each day or distances. Since I'm a 67 yr old diabetic with heart issues, all I need is the steps feature. I would also like to see the app track sleep time. Otherwise, this is an excellent app to consider.","Love it Everything I want and need but wish I could add goals from the app, must go to the website to do that.  An option for custom goals would make this so much better than just having choose from the ones listed.  Cant save a custom activity to favorites. The points redeeming is nonsence because they are outdated or make you pay for shipping.  Love the virtual rewards though!  Will not let me completely start over either.  Love everything else!  Love camp!  Oh the developers do not respond to anything though."],"version":"4.2.5","updated":"May 22, 2014","appId":"com.about.CalorieCount","minInstalls":1000000,"genre":"Health & Fitness","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.about.CalorieCount&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.about.CalorieCount/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.about.CalorieCount/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":100000,"developerEmail":"helpdesk@patricchan.name","screenshots":["//lh6.ggpht.com/ZgX6y-HwUUNzBvZY753RoFwm-9BiDoxBNG2sBj3v9ea0LE06a7PdeSUv4q6kHNz_PF4=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/YV6_YuQVo5XHb-DbTgW4sZrjSNjXwVH9dnCgVcFLk2GJG80F8q0fIe3IcUGdYYdgR_I=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/N5734njWvkW7lsYUC8hckgpZSm5447E0PjsL7aJ-DwH7P8MgDLUhmohq2ReXguAo8R4=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/FUH_3VC9l-K6ulr_G4BSCDU6RYztCWLSqed_ZFbgI8VZ-Nt2nuxwEgiijrCQTBy9HZc2=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.1","contentRating":"Unrated","descriptionHTML":"About Natural Stress Relief Hypnosis to Eliminate Personal and working Stress<br><br>This powerful stress relief hypnosis is created by Elizabeth Harford, licensed UCM minister since 1993 and certified hypnotherapist by the &quot;The National Guild Of Hypnotists&quot; in 2001.<br><br>Stress can be caused by so many factors in life.

However I do not believe in hypnosis or meditation  It might work for some but I can never concentrate. But this is amazing. You actually lose consciousness and your mind drifts When I finished I felt like I woke up from a nap","This app is amazing I was very skeptical. Not after the first night. I use it every night and can feel gentle reminders throughout the day when stressful situations arise and, it calms me. You have nothing to lose by trying this! Do yourself this favor! Love it!","Brilliant for stress relief including panic attacks Have a lot of similar apps but this is my favourite as love the inclusion of natural sounds and it works so well with or without headphones.. Happy uplifting voice helps to as some hypnosis overdoes the heavy voice effect.. Enjoy.. 😁","Turned my life around! I've been suffering terrible stress this last few months, bouncing off the walls and physically shaking at times!  I've used this twice, I now have butterflies of happiness and my limbs feel light again! This is nothing short of miraculous!  Thank you!","BEST APP EVER!!!! So glad I downloaded. Recommending to everyone I know. I use it every night since I found it n sometimes during the day. I'm very anxious n stressed n this is the best thing ever. Can't stress enough how awesome this is! Try at least once n you won't regret it or ever want y go without it again, I know I don't!","OK so if this can work on me it can work on anyone. I have always believed hipnosis wasn't real. Still not sure if it is.but I can say one thing. This totally worked on me. My dress level has gone down a lot and I'm sleeping a lot more.

It is a data base from everywhere but I wasn't able to apply to some from my phone as I would need to send Word documents. Other sites allow you to type it directly in but it is not often. I like having the app so that I can consult it at any given moment and consider if the requirements pertain to me. All in all, if is a better resource if you pay.","Hidden fee much? App sounds great!!! Something to consolidate your searching for scholarships? Wonderful. And it's free? Amazing! Until you actually open the app and you have to pay to do more than open it. That's just a load of crap. Charge out the gate or not at all, don't waste my time.","Kind of mad that I paid for this app a while ago around the time it first came out and now I had to pay for it again? Got a new phone so didn't have it. just remembered to reinstall it and then have to pay $3 to get full access. Umm I already paid to download the app forever ago. Other than that love the app.","Wouldn't work at all I couldn't even sign up to try the app after I downloaded it. It kept telling me there was an unknown error.  Will be deleting the app. Too bad,  because I'm seriously looking for a scholarship.  I saw this on shark tank and thought it would actually have some quality.  Using an s6 active","Really? Similar to other reviewers I was disappointed that the main service Scholly touts (scholarship matches) isn't free. Paying a $2.99 fee to get scholarship matches and keep your information private? Just get to searching on your own and opt out of spam emails. You shouldn't have to pay for scholarships.","Straightforward and Helpful This is a fantastic app to lead you to financial resources. If you are serious about college, spend the $3 to upgrade as you are able to access and track dozens of scholarships. Sometimes the scholarships don't match but the process to remove them from your feed is easy and is only 2 taps.

Are you up to an adventure? I am Abby the Monkey, the friend you know from a highly-successful application series by 22learn, and I have prepared one for you! If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn&#x2019;t wait a minute, and come with me!!! <br><br>But first let me tell you a story&#x2026;. <br>****************************************** <br>Once upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame&#x2014;all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island&#x2019;s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. <br><br>The legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. <br><br>All that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers&#x2019; names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train&#x2019;s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island&#x2019;s precious treasure! <br>****************************************** <br><br>But, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! <br><br>And now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island&#x2019;s treasure together with me?<br><br>22learn developed this app based on the facts and he worked to inspire young children to learning phonics to jump-start the reading process. <br><br>Thank you for your purchase!

Are you up to an adventure? I am Abby the Monkey, the friend you know from a highly-successful application series by 22learn, and I have prepared one for you! If you want to EXPLORE a strange animal island and LEARN PHONETIC LETTER SOUNDS, you shouldn’t wait a minute, and come with me!!! But first let me tell you a story…. ****************************************** Once upon a time, there was an island, an island of indescribable beauty and magnificence. There found a shelter the animals small and large, slimy and furry, savage and tame—all protected from evil hunters and curious eyes, supplied with food from the bountiful earth. Each year, a special event was held, when one, and only one, person from the whole humankind was selected and transported to the island (blinded, to preserve the island’s secrecy) to appreciate its beauty and spread the word about it, so that the island would never be forgotten. The legend has it, that deep inside the rocky hill on the island, a treasure is kept. Yet, no one knows its secret anymore because the last humankind representative had enraged the animals on the island, and since then, the animals decided never to invite anyone again, and the island got lost in time and space. All that remains from our knowledge is that through the whole island, a very special train goes. The train has a mind of its own and likes it when the passengers’ names start from certain sounds! It is said, that if someone was ever capable to fulfill all the train’s wishes, the train would transport the lucky being deep inside the rocks and reveal the island’s precious treasure! ****************************************** But, you are asking, what does all this have to do with me, monkey Abby? Well, imagine what happened to me just recently! I was flying around with my plane when, out of the blue, the storm hit and my plane got lost! And now, I am on this weird island that looks exactly like the legendary Phonics Island I told you about! Wohoo, how exciting! But I need someone to help me with all the strange tasks the train asks me to do! Do you want to be the one who will help me, and discover the island’s treasure together with me?22learn developed this app based on the facts and he worked to inspire young children to learning phonics to jump-start the reading process.

One thing I will say though, is don't take the \"cyclescope\" gems as gospel.","The updates keep making everything bunched up and adding more irrelevant things. I get the talking to other people but everything just looks annoying now. Adding too many irrelevant gems. Definitely Uninstalling.","I liked it, but it won't let me put in my birthday. I downloaded it on February 18th and it asked me for my birthday. I tried to put in Feburary 26th, 2004 but the dates stopped at the 18th :c Idk if its a glitch or what but please help.","Love this app all around! It not only tracks your period, but tells you your fertile days so you can stay safe or know when to make a baby! It also has chats, advice channels and so much more!","It's nice to be able to press a bunch of buttons to record different elements of life. I got the app to help track my utterly unpredictable periods. But the app won't allow for the fact that my period came well before my estimated average. I recorded heavy flow and then period ended. Now Eve keeps saying my period was late. Ugh.","I don't like how (with the new update) I have to press on something to read it then in 2 seconds it disappears then I have to go and click on it again.

I had to enter her age and sex and an image of a female came up. You tap on the part of the body you want to check and you select the symptoms that apply. So far so good.

My ONLY complaint is that despite having the push notifications ENABLED, my phone does NOT tell me that I have a message waiting unless I happen to turn on the screen.  Perhaps an addition to the coding to allow the phone to physically notify users?  An example, Gmail app turns on the indicator light letting me know it has something new.  Overall, great pp otherwise.","I actually love the app but, I get notifications showing someone sent me a message, then when I go to reply, it's gone, completely missing. Even on two seperate occasions I've been talking to a girl, its going well and they just disappear minutes after they ask what we should do on our first date or what I went to school for.  Why would so many woman message me and then instantly block me before I can reply?? They wouldn't! This had been mentioned on Reddit too. Fix it and I'll even get a paid subscription. This is nuts...","Good idea in principle, but let's be honest, when do girls EVER send a message first on dating sites? This app assumes that women want to make an actual effort in getting to know the guy! 6 \"matches\" and still no messages lol!!  Also alot of profiles are fake and duplicated a number of times!","I like the design and not having a mountain of messages (in particular creepy ones) but I don't think this app is for me. Few reply back and the conversations are short and boring. After a while, I felt like I was putting in more work for less reward in comparison to other apps.","It's ok but it should encourage people to fill in some info when they make their profile. Few people do which means there is less to go on than there could be. Also, I tried to backtrack on someone and it didn't work. It backtracked to the person before them. My like que went down after that as well so it would've been a match. Then again, had very little to go on so maybe it doesn't matter. But it might! Just unnecessary.","Out of all the good reviews that I read, it's kind of hard to give it a bad rating, but it's also hard to give it a good rating. .it doesn't allow you to experience the app unless you have a Facebook page. For those of us who simply choose not join Facebook, lose the opportunity ...I think to be an even better app, you should allow all who wish to experience this app, have that opportunity."],"version":"1.9.4","updated":"January 23, 2017","appId":"com.bumble.app","minInstalls":1000000,"genre":"Lifestyle","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bumble.app&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.bumble.app/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.bumble.app/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":5000,"developerEmail":"webmaster@msmagazine.com","screenshots":["//lh6.ggpht.com/N2MYG1JOTP2ClTqhKzBCQaWp30wu4wYM_5m-cLoxrGmQqtTHwWfjcCAXB4HZZEy0qMI=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/dv1MvUOzWzyLOeBXinQsXKvoMEY0OSKFBOEemDRfSCYURj6TKHFe6KmzQkNmxY98hg=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/NBK1s8i1J0rFiFIuoQYAeBpjZikGY6URsH6XZpC6k6vjimU51-ns7xTbuCUY0l4J8W9U=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3","contentRating":"Everyone 10+","descriptionHTML":"Now available for Android!

Other magazine apps can do that, so I expect you to include that in the next update. There will be a next update, right?","Easy to use Definitely easy to use.

I am very interested.","Great Intresting read, and fast and slick app","Love it!","Good app for transgender people….Thumbs Up…. I have a friend who is a transgender and I always like to discuss with her about her feelings and how society treats her. To help her I was looking for some articles in the internet. I found the frock magazine at that time and I also saw it has a mobile version. So I downloaded it and went through some monthly issues and I felt that articles and stories in this magazine deeply discuss about lifestyle of transgender people in the world. One of the interesting story I read in this monthly issue is “Are You Male, Female Or Something Else? You Decide!” which is a quite nice article that should be read by transgender people and their families. App runs smoothing on my mobile and we can add our purchased issues in to a library and do bookmarking. I’m going to introduce frock android app to my friend and I’m sure definitely this magazine will help her lot.","Great News Source This is a well designed app for Transgender news.

Una imagen vale más que mil palabras y \"Mejora Bilbao\" lo hace posible, facilitando el envío de fotos de aquellas quejas o sugerencias importantes para los ciudadanos“Bilbo Hobetuz” herritarren partaidetzarako plataforma da.

Mostly problem with playing 1010 WINS, FOX radio, and any other I play also often unavailable. Didnt work on Lollipop same after update to Marshmallow. My internet is goid with low ping etc. Maybe you should implement some buffer etc. In addition too many ads that take time to close.","It's alright! The stations that I listen to already will play but skip like a scrached cd. Just don't have my country station witch is Bee 93.7. Other then that it's pretty clear.","Good premise, nice looking, flawed. Not a great range of stations. Poor tagging, search. Drops out for a minute at a time. I like the lack of bs, but it needs to be greater in scope and more robust. In other words it should do exactly what it does without unnecessary social crap etc, but should do it much better.","It works better on my smartphone it's an S7 over TuneIn Radio but it is hard to find a radio stations especially talk radio! For example I search for Rush Limbaugh and came up with nothing","This app was awful.  I couldn't find any of my stations, it didn't even have the ones I was looking for. Don't waste your time on this.","Im too lazy so I don't write reviews bt this app shocked me! It loads instantly and the interface is easy to navigate plus it has Every station I need.

I finally gave in and bought a mega deal package for 85% less than the yearly full rate therefore after the exchange calculations it came to $12.00 instead of $40,00 for the subscription. Still would like to see more options offered for lines and elements selections. I like the new colour palettes but would still like more colour combinations and themes offered for those with paid subscriptions!💖💚💜","Enjoying coloring and using colors I like creating the look I want. Having getting used to how everthing works now doing better with the app and really enjoying it. Helps to relax and think about nothing except what colors to use! I'm disappointed in the way hearts are given I go thru the pictures of others and if I feel it deserves a heart I give them one.  I have seen some pictures that are not that good and they have over 100 hearts.  Maybe everybody doesn't rate the pictures, but that's what makes it fun!  I paid for a month to see what it would unlock and I'm pleased to say I haven't had any problems with my subscription yet.","Love this app, but I purchased the mega bundle for 9.99 and I only had it about 3 days. They have no record of my purchase so I sent them proof and it still hasn't been resolved. They just took my money!","I really like it just Wish there were more selections in the free part before I decide to buy... Kind Of a waist of money in my opinion It's be nice if in the add you clearly state you have to pay for more complex and not just free basics because on your add it's says \"FREE\" lame....","Great overall. But some of the images seem to be thrown together and are rather sloppy. Lines that don't meet where they should. Non existent where they should be. Sometimes an extra line added just because. However, overall, wonderful app, and I will continue to use. Especially when new images are added frequently.","i absolutely love this app. i have a crazy collection of adult coloring books, and am an artist as well, so knowing that now i can do it on my phone is a lot of fun. i have major depressive disorder and anxiety, so this app helps me through my bad moments, along with my creative waves.

Everyone is nice and no one is judging because are all striving towards a goal and we all help one another to achieve it. This is a great place to ask questions about Pilates.  Yoga, what kind of food to eat, etc everyone is so helpful and its really well designed app. Love the pink!","It's not really free I feel like it's odd that when you subscribe on her website you get the calendar for free, but you have to pay for it in the app? I would love to have the calendar on my phone, but I don't trust in app purchases, since relatively often they don't show up correctly. It's also odd that you can't search for specific videos, or maybe I can't find the way to do that? This app is not at all useful for my purposes.","This app really needs some work This app has so much potential! After using for a long time these are my main feedback points. Make the back button on samsung compatible. When I press the back button it takes me to the homepage despite what I was doing. Its infuriating. The calendar should be customisable. I want to tick off what days I worked out on the app while I complete PIIT28 but it is a fixed calendar. You should be able to exit the timer and re-enter without it starting over/turning off. An app dedicated to PIIT28 might be better.","Since i started my weightloss journey, ive always loved casey ho. She is such an inspiration. From 65kgs. down to 56kgs., even if I wasnt able to follow piit28. It was a 3 months workout following her routines which were uploaded in youtube. Many thanks to her!!!","Too Many In-App Purchases I like the timer, but I find it misleading how the app is presented as \"free\" in Blogilates videos. There are too many in-app purchases to be able to actually use the app well. To pay for the alarm itself when doing a HIIT workout, the videos, the calendar, etc...is too much.

First of all, the price points are messed up one buying gold and gems. The 3.99 price point comes up as $50 and the other prices show up as far more as well. $50 for 200 Jim  and 1400 gold pieces is ridiculous so I can't imagine that's correct. For some reason the second cat goes straight to sleep everytime time I open the app and I can't stop him. He's been stinky and hungry for like 5 days now. If the prices were corrected I would buy, and if the second cat issue were fixed I would definitely rate higher.","I love everything  in this game it is amazing I'll Evan give him a shout out on all social media in have 1 request may we please be able to have 3 kittens","I like it this game it's amazing I like the graphics l don't know what to say but the game is amazing and l like it more than talking Tom and Angela the game is perfect 👍👍👍","I love most of the kittens just not the ginormous one other wise it is really well","The Spinwheel defies gravity the house is ugly and needs more interactions and less money.","I liked the cat and that stuff but there's way to many adds."],"version":"2.9.6","updated":"February 5, 2017","appId":"com.honikougames.dailykitten","minInstalls":5000000,"genre":"Casual","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.honikougames.dailykitten&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.honikougames.dailykitten/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.honikougames.dailykitten/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":50000000,"developerEmail":"scrubbydubby.techhelp@king.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/1QhPx7v9JCyircSIdYK5V6be7JZ0I0BWaTFy8evNHMtcBtmgfNG0Th6hcRA_EHPA5w=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wMWMj_gaA-7bkesLFwETds1kRooe38WATqLUEAUqImUFOCI1DEdF3H-WRhoTq24RiQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/yvQClwKRj1HtZDYS378zd94ou1eE6L32z8P_19YQxaMw_GLTIMsbOYAeel2T8aNUlw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Rl8-rjl3ZN_5fxzrSf3mKoFHOoa7vBibz-OsAj7JXqNTA9SCC6dBMOldGqdg3BRMWec=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CFGkrcsCsCxrRDe6nCZd0xyJY1_n_kavmd5_WP_eWeQz18Q-0fQYUiT2YEWQDm1ERwE=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lqlbZIOEn2hi5lTUxrt8C6mJwU1kUV9QICg97jZvUeZmsJl1CFVbPQrNmdAxmy_aOQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/znplPCQlUzZhhVGBl881WwXD8r2NheGkCJQiXqElT4XfnKQNZLzO5V8UNyeZELCr-6s=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/N6jgbdzoX3SZfowjO8CTbdUN0UQQRgr0ccMiaU-QcR9eBzoCcR8UQE0fuKnr3LV8FY0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/aNePzPGwC3hPK3xE9Pxcw3OvzwB0CBFWu3kuVd_u4Ps0d377_3e9ELz44KWk21iKdQU=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/g4mpgoZM7Hh7Uji5IzIQ6XnESeeStA9MWOKHURAFzHzmSeN9Ngfc5RR5qYxIaEqvmUk_=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mVQO49G-IMp6sptZOVvqGzw49I7N9_wYId2JmrQVuVZuTFfqKlBTnOaywrOv799K8M0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/fEzcJaMwrCted38CElFCdHB06VSeoWF-DdWtC76kFM4yMDgnW43fkJCP4aDRRPVUN5Q=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/M7iUGVQesLs8R2EcrnRHy7I0jER70uSQAad43JzjtT8L94ze3ESUenmBE4NM_-3vSQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/OiALfrnnPOOsTV8AvXt-HmVvc6XesbX2knmWhh5Uhoqxlfq8v3s0PB11NOHm0x4XfZlr=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/XQB1h2N9IRemINeSwkkZOv8vOM7VotbouLBsEMAoWsxOEDI6qFJJE52SEk20upCZQVM=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/MFgFThbwM-Uz0-jU8655By1ZFWhLkeGqpcvhLHj3p-vewfMOkc3xLch44Chzp5OaOq8=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tj-Hc3A0Tb0BZ4a3AjpE2E54jVCfGmgrPMa1oY__73cz5_bunKQO18J3oFBBusax44Y=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NzrOjOfKMBsJqIHW2LVOky4bMKh05fr3LUpt-hLoZZD_Zx1WAB0uSm5HDU-3nRiI2Ks=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.0","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Scrubby Dubby Saga, from the makers of Candy Crush Saga &amp; Farm Heroes Saga!&#xA0;<br><br>Soapland is full of a mysterious foam but nobody knows why.

At least give us a quest option to unlock levels faster than waiting 3 days and I will rate the game higher.","uhhhh....so what did you guys do to the map on this game?? How are we supposed to play any previous levels? That was a horrible idea.... I hope you guys put out an update fixing the game back to where we can at least play previous beaten levels...u cant be serious King..","Where did all the previous levels played go to??? Can't go back and play any of the levels already played since the new update. :( Please bring them back. Would also like a way to earn coins :)","I hate new homepage. I like to  could choose lvl.

I only wish it's notifications skin themed according to the apps style chooser. That white is crucial on a Blacked out OS... If that could happen this would truly be a 360° perfectly well rounded application.  👌 currently only way I've found to blackout notification is run classic with chart on, set it to high priority.  But that's a bit heavy just for dark notifications,  but is what it is.  Please make notification themeable!","Informative and Essential A must for every Android device owner, this app provides comprehensive information about the battery; it completes the Android OS. The screen saver display is perfect: big and fat and glowing. Knowing the charging rate helped me diagnose a battery problem. Moreover, the developer is known to be hard working and sincere.","Thanks  to  developers coz quite long time im find the apps can help my note 2 samsung and i just see the review from here and i immediately purchased... to others really  recommended  for  those hv battery  problems.. so happy  n thanks  again ftom malaysia","Perfection You get what you pay for and this thing blows all the other apps out of the water.

Hope there will be more levels available because I'm just about through the 1st 14!! As for getting more diamonds quicker, suck it up buttercups...that's the point. You pay ONCE (I haven't, btw) and you get bonuses every day that you don't get playing for free. You also so that have to watch all the vids.","Game is really fun to play but you can't fully   enjoy the variety of weapons without paying for them . The game would  be SO much better if you made them more accessible. Graphics are okay but  the way the guys fall or even the way the bad guys with parachutes fall can loom kind of cheesy. All in all the game is awesome for being free!!","This game is NOT FREE, I would have paid £30 and have had full access rather being drawn in to buy upgrades every time you play. And the straw that has broken the camels back is today after it was updated it keeps crashing. Dont play it find someting else.","Good graphics and an easy, fun way to kill some time.  After about the third city, if you only use earned coins to buy sniper rifles you can make it through all the levels without having to spend any actual money.  Definitely a little racist though.  A disproportionate amount of the targets are Black/Latin/Indian.","just lost  bout 2-3 weeks worth of progress, was ok at home, but got to work and my progress was set back about 3 weeks. I tried restore purchases and there was \" nothing to restore\".i uninstalled and reinstalled and now i'm back to the start. I put a lot of effort into this and now its all gone. I had just got a gun good enough  for gold level on world ops too, what a bummer.

Resize tiles, change tile image (I love some of the images you have for some tiles) add or delete pages. I could go on but then I'd be nit picking. Get those in, cause those are freaking basic launcher items, and you'll get 5 stars and a purchase.","Not quite Win10 Mobile on Android, but best of what I have seen so far.  OK, so a Windows 8.1 phone is my persona daily driver, and I am trialling Windows 10 Mobile via the preview process, so I think I am pretty qualified to say that this is not the best experience of the Windows Mobile tile interface for die hard Windows Phone fans who are forced to use Android because of the lack of developer support on Windows Phone.   However, it is the best I have seen so far.  It needs to allow for all the features of the Windows 10 tile experience, including the transparency options, folders, tile resizing, etc.. You also need the ability to  customise the start screen layout in the same way as Windows 10 mobile.  You may be able to use widgets to emulate the live tiles.  If only Microsoft would port the Win10 experience to Android - maybe I should be careful what I wish for, after all they are porting everything else :)","Doesn't do the Win10 name justice. This is a badly mashed together skinned front end which assumes you have the developers favourite apps rather than building a list from what is in your device.  Has no list mode and the icons are even badly misplaced the moment you touch them. Give it a miss.  You won't be missing anything worthwhile.","Would be nice if I could move or add tiles around. The background wouldn't reset. The ads include audio. That's the last thing I want in a quiet situation to hit the home key and a loud ad starts playing. There was a full app list instead of a slider because when the search hardly works, sometimes let's me pick a letter then the keyboard disappears. The ads should be in tiles not a huge pop up. The level of customizability is almost zero. Looks nice, but that's about it.","Background issue I change my background like 50 times a day we'll did the first 4 days then said screw it please fix I'd like to keep my background as it was but it always goes to default when I'm not looking sneaker bugger. Other then that and the adds its awesome. 5 stars if both changed 4 for  no more bugs and deletes games I've downloaded don't get this b.s. app","Worse app It is not a god app u will think that ur phone will look like windows 10 but it won't look as I have used windows 10 and it is not like that it is very slow.

No idea how, it never use to. Well done :-). I've just read the low star reviews and some of the problems I can clearly see are just silly user errors.

Was very smooth process pairing it with the echo. (1st time using smart home tech) They explain it easily. But the only thing I wished Kasa had that would destroy Phillips Hue is if with Alexa, you can also control the THEMES. Hopefully in a future update. Then 5 stars for sure. But app overall is very user friendly.","The app has a walk through for installing a switch when you first connect it. That was helpful. Connecting it to my Amazon Echo was easy. If the app had the ability to set a schedule based on your local sunrise and sunset that auto adjusted throughout the year id give the app a 5 star. Adding more support IFTTT would make the app great. It was difficult to find the scheduling, hint you have to click on the device to set a schedule for it. Which seems intuitive now.","I've been using Kasa for four months with a TP-link smart switch wired to a pair of outdoor outlets that power roof heating cables. Setup was really easy and there have been no problems. I use Alexa for voice control of the switch, but have not been able to make her function as a timer or even report if the cables are on or off. Kasa does provide on/off  information, though, and we were able to control the cables from afar while vacationing in the south over the holidays. I just added a TP-link outlet in my office that controls a small lamp. Alexa supports groups, and so the lamp can function as an indicator of the status of the roof cables.","Please add the ability to select a an RGB value for color changing bulbs as an alternative to the selection grid to allow a user to select specific colors. In addition, please add the option to select one color for a group instead of setting each bulb manually for a scene. Also, please consider adding Tasker integration. I would fill my entire house with TP-Link bulbs and plugs if Kasa had Tasker integration. Your user base would increase exponentially with this.. just saying!!","Don't like that TP Link has been around a lot longer than many competitors, yet they still haven't worked with Google to make it Home compatible. Even more shocking, no IFTT support. Just Alexa and kasa to control your oversized TP Link wifi wall plug. They are cheaper still than any other brand wall plug. You get what you pay for I guess...","Works fantastic with amazon echo.  Devices have really quick response (quicker than our philips Hue lights).  The only issue i have with the plugs, is that they are really large.  They have to be plugged into the top outlet, and the bottom of the plug somewhat blocks the bottom outlet, making some other plugs unusable.  The app is super easy to use and connects to alexa without going through a ton of hoops."],"version":"1.4.4.607","updated":"December 21, 2016","appId":"com.tplink.kasa_android","minInstalls":100000,"genre":"Lifestyle","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.kasa_android&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.tplink.kasa_android/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.tplink.kasa_android/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":5000,"developerEmail":"dlaender@gmail.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/70vJEZCZP8ufEkSnsO8tAITxBVe9YxIhT6f2S8KM331TcrMBAJa2fIQuJyJwzpnSdL82=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/KKi_q3nXwHM7OgtfYvwOIgVC69VugPY7VmFJsA2pibcFoVek1fa4S_1lrhz_wyVlTg=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/aZKB6EW7i6zuIzux4dHCOJIUSqkcMiIvQH5GHoC_EWoHdJI032dZ8cpQiwxQ_7HwIyc=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PUPqxOdraH-l1wfl_lgXiGaixClbP8_d8t5P8poeZravBrLr4bTVyjiLaggIT51yHx8=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/JiqquCyRVvXNGPiBgTXYNFHqq3jU5zLq0SeJ3OyFkwnNQfnpC5XpLs3y_F2S8wsjYw=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.0","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Welcome to the United Nations Foundation App - a place where we connect you with the United Nations.

The increased trophy rewards should be applied to everyone who already has them too!","Great game, but the most recent update did not apply the improved rewards retroactively. I'm now considering starting over, just to claim Soul/Golden Eggs I rightly earned after the trophies were first added. Please compensate those of us who played your game before the latest update!","Very addictive. This game will pass time very quick. After upgrading your eggs a few times you start to modify your strategy, but helps more and each time you. Good graphics. Looking forward to bigger things coming with future upgrades.","Fun game to play but with your most recent adjustment to trophy rewards it seems that I was cheated on large amounts of soul eggs that is not compensated for trophies already eanred. Please fix and I will gladly give 5 stars","Unending, yet addictive, drone shooter 2017. The gameplay quickly becomes: shoot drones as your primary source of income, and spend time to wait for chickens to accumulate. Egg value over time basically means nothing, as you get more from 10 seconds of gameplay than you do the 4 hours your away time covers.  But here's the worst bit. The numbers to upgrade to the next eggs are obscene, and the Devs keep releasing new ones, rescaling the value you need to make in order to upgrade. Overnight you could go from being 1 away to being 400 decillion away. What's more, the players who have spent weeks and weeks grinding for trophies worth significant rewards have had to enjoy the Devs updating those rewards to 200x their original value - and not retroactively reimbursing the original players with the new rewards.  Tbh I think it's time for me to leave this game. I can't be beaten by it if it's not the same game I started playing all those months ago.

I love just about everything it has to offer. Except one thing. I accidentally bought a small chest for 600 gems. All I did was accidentally click it, and it instantly bought! No yes or no option, just buys it! Not happy about that. Also, we can't sell decorations or buildings. Nor can we flip buildings and decorations. Please add that feature.","Love it! I love this game so much already (I haven't been playing for long) and I haven't found any glitches yet which is great! One small thing though, could you please add a fence or something to keep villagers in and monsters out? It would really help me :) I'm not sure if you'll read this or not but you have made an amazing game so thank you and I hope you keep updating etc :)","Don't buy anything If you like the -10 minute skip.  Once you pay for something you can never use the 10 minute skip ever again. Very bad. When I pay I don't expect a feature to be removed. It was always an option. Now it's gone. Why remove an option when it's not forced? Makes no sense. Bring back the 10 minute skip!","Game was fun until it started doing random apps while I was playing. . 3 game previews in less then 5min makes it hard to play a game when It's just videos. Games getting deleted. . Why have a game I can't play without watching a stupid app every 15 seconds.","Awesome!!! Duh. For those who were complaining about ads? TURN OFF YOU WIFI OR DATA. My phone is not so good but it is running perfectly. About the one who is always crushing, maybe your phone is the problem. nahh. but this game really rocks. And also it give me ideas about builds in minecraft. Thanks!!!","Not exactly my sort of game. A little too cookie cutter for my tastes. Simple build, upgrade, build, upgrade type of game that I've been playing for years. Thought there might be some genuine exploration or adventuring given the games visual influence, but was sadly disappointed by the extremely linear gameplay.

For instance, I start my day at 1pm and end it at 3am. This messes up my day process. Next I sometimes forget to use the app when I smoke, so I'd love to be able to edit the amount I've smoked in a day on the next day so the amount saved is more accurate.","One of the best apps I have used for anything. It is very straight forward.  This app does work on you being honest also.  I drive for a living.  At times I have too much time on my hands and would grab a cigarette.  The how many hours a day part can be confusing.  I do wish it had a button to push for going to bed.  If you use this app honestly, you will be able to quit smoking.  Coming from being a 20 year smoker.  Has great features that will make you think.","Great for Quitting I like this app because it HELPS you quit, not like others where you say \"I quit today\" and that's it. I do not use it with the wearable application. I would like to see an option to have the time between smokes adjust itself for the allowed cigarettes left in a day if you smoke more/before the allowed to smoke time, and an option to change the start time for your day.","Smoke free Absolutely awesome app. Sometimes it's tough to stick to it but so far I've been able to do it and it works. I would like to be able to set it for the time I actually get up and go to bed instead of having the timer start at the time I install the app. I've smoked 15 today instead of my average of 3o and mostly haven't missed them. I always smoke more first thing in the morning and I just have to ignore the timer. But then the rest of the day if I don't hear the timer I'll go over by quite a bit.","An android app for quitting gradually Used to have an iphone and used the livestrong app to quit smoking a few years ago. This is definitely the closest you're going to get on an android. Really can't complain but I wish there was a way to turn the timer off, and add a feature that shows the time when you smoked each cigarette.","I like it alot This approach to quitting makes sense. I managed to suppress my cravings till the timer runs out. I'm also able to track the number of cigarettes I smoke each day. I'm not a non smoker yet but believe I will get there if I follow this program."],"version":"3.1.3","updated":"August 20, 2016","appId":"com.motivebite.smokefree.free","minInstalls":100000,"genre":"Health & Fitness","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motivebite.smokefree.free&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.motivebite.smokefree.free/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.motivebite.smokefree.free/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":1000000,"developerEmail":"service@xombat.dk","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zG5y4UhwiXf17nI1i5GRq8vfmLtoDjd9j1zYjVrKw6cw7anzrOK2l2iaFI-dMULHZYg=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/_R9Cqpg68gmb1l_LY-2Fz6y88N3W7W4dr_t_FdloTMu7HXmWtTy4Qy_ETrO0-z-TJQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/9AfCv5WG0mzbXKP9mJ5a8E2_aU2Ulwn-bKqxP_ixPFVGWLyvCfINIZA6GDXsoNG50g=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ejk_5eygdeik0qbumkQ1tLh7u3t_M25q2Yg3acis3b-XVreCiQsrZUwXG9EwX_1y8w=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/k7Pi00izvt99KnCsGzuLW3dvHBizJAW6xwlDAFHUq1HsKmANOdHekPRC-8M7QoDMcl4Q=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/qzGWDDbJywtlhGNjV19mbirATWwIKPk7K7McOXJQVHlfaDzHvb1HzGh53_gjv5UfG6U=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/hyCdlCzSb3RBnVqfEh88N24zZKnWlF3MbsGMeBdLXQ0xTMmIsTxisOpSd83ryT2JLA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-lhzCjrybsOagfJbk8p56oMxve6ac6gzx8EItEYjOkM8y7GbhgxRZUlC9tV8fK-G8IM=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.0","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"In Shipping Manager you start out by creating your own shipping company at the location you desire.<br><br>Throughout the game you will need to make management decisions in order to see your company gain a profit.<br><br>You will be the one in charge of purchasing new vessels, creating routes for them, negotiating contracts, assessing risks, and managing the staff.<br><br>You will be able to see the share value of your company increase, as well as make well investments in other companies.<br><br>You can compete with your friends and find out if you can be a better manager than they can.<br><br>Do you have what it takes to run a billion dollar business ?","adSupported":false,"histogram":{"1":1555,"2":593,"3":1201,"4":3523,"5":5696},"free":true,"reviews":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/dk.xombat.shippingmanager/reviews","genreId":"GAME_SIMULATION","developerWebsite":"http://www.xombat.dk","title":"Shipping Manager","price":"0","url":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/dk.xombat.shippingmanager","offersIAP":true,"androidVersionText":"4.0 and up","summary":"Manage your own shipping company.

Really enjoying this game and still playing however, completing achievements doesn't earn me my FOB points. I have posted in the error reporting and still no response from dev.

Its a great game but don't expect to get any FOB points for achievements to unlock bonus items!","Good game but needs work. The game as a whole is well thought out and a lot of fun. However, the developer has put a feedback and error board within the game and they do not appear to be correcting the problems.  The main problem being with the FOB points not being distributed and the achievements not registering. There are numerous post within the outboard and I have yet to see a response from the developer.  If the developer correct these problems then I'll rate 5 out of 5.","It's a lovely game I love the game but I have a feeling that you will do just fine until you reach a certain level. The app gets harder (takes longer to fuel vessels when you have loads of them) and you shouldn't charge for the fuel capacity upgrade because the 900million self-made vessels charge 14k fuel. Please fix this in someway.. I get that you need to make money but the game gets boring when you have played abt. 1 year... I will gladly upgrade this to a 5 star when you do something about it! Thanks!","Cool - Start up there is a typo \"contry\" should be \"country\".  - FAQ also minor typos.  \"i\" should be capitalized.  It's got a cool concept but I started a game, filled up ship with fuel and sent it.  After that you don't do anything and have to wait many, many hours (8 hour wait for me) for your ship to travel.  So in that sense is pretty boring starts for the game.   Hopefully there is more to do after starting a new game.  Mini-game where you have to dock or load up some containers would be cool addition.","Good..  Can be Better Increasing your share capital does not increase cash in hand. The stock exchange needs improvement. Players selling shares should have a negative impact and vice versa. Vessels should be able to call multiple ports, specially oil tankers. Introduction of chemical, LNG tankers could breath new life into the game. Mobile version should have all features of Facebook version.","Needs further improvements Not getting the FOB points in the app for  achievements is nit good not one reply from the developer yet several people have posted on their forum about the issue. Needs better functionality with regards to freight carried as it shows as a %age rather than tonnes available to ship. Could be a 5* game but I'm being generous giving 3 just now due to the issues and need for further development"],"version":"1.1.1","updated":"September 11, 2015","appId":"dk.xombat.shippingmanager","minInstalls":500000,"genre":"Simulation","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.xombat.shippingmanager&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/dk.xombat.shippingmanager/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/dk.xombat.shippingmanager/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":50,"developerEmail":"ijordiatienza@yahoo.es","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/MU32paVIQCJ5tAvj0Ndcp8NzwwmuoroqhyLFt3tJPIe_vVLqnfTbCqKhu1NN7sEQkPo=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/iHKBymlazUTEjV9OlzeCbZjY2SNDE7ugX805eWKo2d1pay8WKQStDHMLG6F-_soyWRAr=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lT_Pg5kaSkGyRO2obf6mItVTrXouPAqgQDXbtUk1mGTHEbysUSkH6bsbHn8mPQMgVA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/bPPCvaN-OFndPhn2b7u3h4Krsd8C-ApOt3xzLupHryTo8k_3cmUWhFNzSQXdomjl0Q=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/gFY5fAOnQfPGR2ZisVBWm0dJ14-xK_p2kBWrF_nNvVzEkzcsiHGinEGnPKQONmoNpUM=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3.3","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"(AD FREE VERSION)<br>Published in 1926, George S.

When I found the one I wanted and looked at carb count for desired meal, potato dishes NOT included. Shame on you, ADA. You should know how important that info is for type 1 diabetics.","Helpful The only problem I have with this app, (1) Some menus need updated. I have been a diabetic for 16 years now with no education for controlling my A1C and sugar level. I'm now in classes that are show me how to count carbs, this app is free and helpful.","Missed the boat If it is to promote healthy eating, why do the menus displayed show some of the worst food choices and omit, seemingly, all the best that a restaurant has to offer? Really a single menu item that has 57 carbs in one serving? I expected that the choices would eliminate the bad and emphasize the best!","Totally useless Why organizations like the ADA feel compelled to release junk like this is beyond me.

В ней собрались мастера по политике, психологии, бизнесу, культуре, философии, истории и эзотерики. Мы сделали упор на конкретике и детальности описания. Наши статьи довольно обширны и не умещаются в три четыре абзаца. Во-первых, серьезную тему на одной странице не раскроешь, вы согласны? А во-вторых, наш журнал приятно почитать погрузившись в выбранную тему, а не скакать от одного раздела к другому.Для этого есть масса бесплатных предложений, где серьезные темы представлены в виде 10 картинок и двух абзацах, но мы считаем это не приемлемым.В нашем коллективе сидят люди, многим которым из них уже за 50, и все что мы хотим, - это донести до вас знания. Качественно, развернуто и интересно.Дорогие наши читатели, мы считаем, что в каждом из нас живет искатель знаний.

Durch industrielles Coworking l&#xE4;sst sich die schleichende De-Industrialisierung verhindern und Innovationskraft st&#xE4;rken. Viele Coworking Ideen sind integraler Bestandteil der Industrie4.0 Prozesse in der Kooperation von Produktionen. Erfinder und T&#xFC;ftler arbeiten beim Cooworking Hand-in-Hand mit der Stamm-Mannschaft. Keinesfalls ist Coworking Production losgel&#xF6;st von gemeinsamer Betriebs- und Fl&#xE4;chennutzung zu sehen: Coworking benutzt gerade diese kreativen und zeitlichen Freir&#xE4;ume. Beispiel f&#xFC;r Produktions-Coworking sind Rapid Prototyping, 3D-Druck und Musterbau. Besonders f&#xFC;r individualisierte KLeinserien eignet sich Coworking aus der Industrie4.0 Definition. Coworking ist somit vor allem Geisteshaltung und erst im zweiten Schritt kooperative Zusammenarbeit. Mittels Coworking lassen sich Auftragsspitzen gl&#xE4;tten und die Schichtauslastung gew&#xE4;hrleisten. In OWL, dem Mittelstand und der traditionellen Serienfertigung war Coworking zun&#xE4;chst unbekannt, bis Maschinen-, M2M- und Lagerkapazit&#xE4;ten knapp wurden, bei gleichzeitigem Anstieg an Kundenvarianten mit schneller Lieferzeit. Coworking bietet Unabh&#xE4;ngigkeit von Kapitalbindung, Ort, Zeit und Menge. Vor diesem Hintergrund l&#xE4;sst Coworking das IoT oder Internet der Dinge in der Produktion zu. Coworking ist die Umsetzung innovativer Ideen mit Hilfe von Hochtechnologie, besonders CNC und M2M Coworking Steuerungen als remote Arduino Cloud-Anwendungen. Kooperatives und interaktives Coworking bedient sich gemeinsamem Workspace an Daten und Produktionsfl&#xE4;che zu pauschalierten Gemeinkosten. Intelligentes oder smart Coworking spricht Industrie4.0 Vorgehensweisen in Form von Arbeiten4.0 an. Damit ist Coworking kompatibel mit pers&#xF6;nlciher Work-Life-Balance in Abstimmung und Kooperation von iterativen Coworking-Schritten. Gerade diese Coworking Vorteile machen es als Production Coworking so einmalig und gewinnbringend umsetzbar. Jede Branche, Maschinenbelegung und Personalteam kann Coworking umsetzen oder kooperativ begleitet anwenden. Der Begriff Coworking ist ja aus diesem Grund auch nicht auf die Produktion, sondern auch auf die Verwaltung erweiterbar. Coworking als App-Kooperation vereint Ideen und industrielle Industrie4.0 Kapazit&#xE4;ten perfekt.","adSupported":false,"histogram":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":6},"free":true,"reviews":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/westaflex.coworking/reviews","genreId":"BUSINESS","developerWebsite":"https://westaflex.com/coworking","title":"Coworking","price":"0","url":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/westaflex.coworking","offersIAP":false,"androidVersionText":"2.3.3 and up","summary":"Success through co-engineering.

Coworking ist somit vor allem Geisteshaltung und erst im zweiten Schritt kooperative Zusammenarbeit. Mittels Coworking lassen sich Auftragsspitzen glätten und die Schichtauslastung gewährleisten. In OWL, dem Mittelstand und der traditionellen Serienfertigung war Coworking zunächst unbekannt, bis Maschinen-, M2M- und Lagerkapazitäten knapp wurden, bei gleichzeitigem Anstieg an Kundenvarianten mit schneller Lieferzeit. Coworking bietet Unabhängigkeit von Kapitalbindung, Ort, Zeit und Menge. Vor diesem Hintergrund lässt Coworking das IoT oder Internet der Dinge in der Produktion zu. Coworking ist die Umsetzung innovativer Ideen mit Hilfe von Hochtechnologie, besonders CNC und M2M Coworking Steuerungen als remote Arduino Cloud-Anwendungen. Kooperatives und interaktives Coworking bedient sich gemeinsamem Workspace an Daten und Produktionsfläche zu pauschalierten Gemeinkosten. Intelligentes oder smart Coworking spricht Industrie4.0 Vorgehensweisen in Form von Arbeiten4.0 an. Damit ist Coworking kompatibel mit persönlciher Work-Life-Balance in Abstimmung und Kooperation von iterativen Coworking-Schritten. Gerade diese Coworking Vorteile machen es als Production Coworking so einmalig und gewinnbringend umsetzbar. Jede Branche, Maschinenbelegung und Personalteam kann Coworking umsetzen oder kooperativ begleitet anwenden. Der Begriff Coworking ist ja aus diesem Grund auch nicht auf die Produktion, sondern auch auf die Verwaltung erweiterbar. Coworking als App-Kooperation vereint Ideen und industrielle Industrie4.0 Kapazitäten perfekt.","comments":[],"version":"1.4","updated":"December 6, 2015","appId":"westaflex.coworking","minInstalls":100,"genre":"Business","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=westaflex.coworking&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/westaflex.coworking/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/westaflex.coworking/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":5000,"developerEmail":"info@transportasi.co","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/_tgCk88xHkiGNuhOMq42iG9ZK-I8876U7Bn9udGRN7XfutSH7BDDCaERM6FY5qgLNQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/dAmTmjDCAuqrC4VacQd30XAIjP3ks_qyuQ1r3gWR4WrxNjIopo6j_810s17kbbhg6w=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/euZkwxzbh48ViTBbfeYte8fzM9mhfdIVCeyS04LMKg9EQhwL8iqnopL3KDtAhNa2LQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/nab8qIiIsGRysPkWV4V-U8Cn5XQPzD52zH8bZYW6gHPkOZ3Y4aYmJ9WEFsNkUYywObw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/usstXsj9kS1uZCRGHe2IUN6bclLn_bjQQcaKtr0lW98n6yL-D-7xKMCDTcQSMho6hdO8=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CwFlBpaxdRq56hN4KTsdwPLQVg9tJ8BqavdzM21CsK-hha6jd0C2UCj3fDiwjYsTlJzO=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pwXbL0ojHlRiAlT9RKcI5uH7pB60-OfBJE71R2D2PX06Ff2nsJ0IH_HM4-DnxEGEPE9A=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.0.3","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Transportasi Indonesia sebagai  sebuah  media yang fokus pada  industri  transportasi dan infrastruktur.

The plotting feature is easy and informative - unlike any other app so far.  The plotter give possibilities like no other app of this type, the same with the rest of the program.  Many critical functions not found in any other app, including GeoGebra.  The free version is really useful and the paid version is worth EVERY cent - I would know, I'm using this program since two years and can't imagine being without it, even when using GeoGebra or other suits.  Sure, it has it's limitations, but which program doesn't.  Really indispensable.","Amazing! I love this calculator!  As an engineer and math teacher, I am on the constant look out for a new reliable, comprehensive calculator.  After trying many others, MathAlly has knocked me off my feet in astonishment!  I consider myself very lucky to have found such a noteworthy app.  MathAlly has placed itself high on my list of best app developers.  One of the easiest 5 stars I have given","So far very impressed Love the gesture keyboard. Up is always what you expect. Hate these context sensitive swipes where what you get depends on where you are. In Some apps its always a complete surprise. IMO if you can't explain to someone what they must over the phone without first asking what they see then your interface has failed. Love the tuts. Concise and to the point. Well worth the money.. It's free? Can't be...","Great Calculator This calculator has an amazing amount of functions. Just found out today that it can solve systems of equations. It can also do definite integrals and matrix operations. I haven't done too much with the graphing part, but what I have done is amazing. I'd prefer this calculator over a $140 one.","An excellent app but I miss indefinite integration.. also i want regression analysis to be included in this & make data import & export possible either via csv or text..also i don't find how to evaluate a function f(x) at x=constant. suppose i want to take derivative of f(x) @ x=constant..","This app is absolutely amazing.

Only on the very last puzzle did I notice it has soothing sounds. I generally keep the noise off on my phone so I can use it at work. There are more than enough puzzles for you to be able to figure out whether the paid version is worth it to you. I will probably get the paid version soon.","Nice Enjoyed this very much. Could maybe go up to 6 or 7 and Deadly is still easy to do within ten minutes. Not keen on the orange though, not easy to see. I will go through them again to reduce my time, &lt;2 minutes for Easy, &lt;3 for the next etc. Also, I agree with those who wish for an Undo All button to start again.","What is wrong with the game??? I have loved playing this for years, and now when I open it the screen is black and nothing happens. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still a black screen. Anyone else have this problem??","Excellent. Small bug with error display: sometimes the error color is not removed until I clear the square and retype the number. It also needs some features like undo, save/load checkpoint, some automation of notes.","Any way to take off the sound? The puzzle is very interesting but I find very annoying that you can't take off the sounds. If I can, I will give a five. If I can't, I will uninstall it and give a one.","Pretty good implementation One of the best implementations of a Futoshiki game I've found, but needs a few extra tweaks to make it great. It needs an undo feature, in case you accidentally set a number when you didn't mean to. It needs to record the fastest time to solve a level rather than the last time. Also an indication of which level you just solved on the list would be great.

Hit a rough spot in my studies and these videos are really helping me understand what I missed. The instructor has all the charisma of Ben Stein, but he does an excellent job of explaining the problems. Overall very helpful!","Helpful but laggy Application looks okay, is very laggy because it seems to be browser based, streams all videos which sometime take a lot of time to buffer, up to 10 minutes for a 3 minute video,   takes 5-10 seconds to load each tab when you navigate as well ... Never seen an app this slow before, have tried two devices and three net connections. Would definitely not purchase again, shame I missed the refund window. Unusable","Occasional wrong answer to practice questions. So far, I'm only through the \"consecutive integers\" section, to which the \"xtra\" question 7 asks for an even integer answer, but the key lists odd integers. Now the videos on age questions won't play... Also, regularly, the teacher says \"this is a good habit to get into\" but infuriatingly, never, ever volunteers the logic behind this statement.  Practice 6 of wind current problems mixes kph and miles. Whoever edited this should be fired.","You won't regret it It's a bit pricey at 10 bucks but i couldn't  put a price on understanding algebra..at last!","Easy to use Read the reviews and bought it it is the best math help I've ever had I have struggled for years and could not understand it this app helped me learn math that I wish I was able to back in high school it is helping me enhance my career and personal enrichment","Excelent courses I'm reviewing my math after about 30 years and I'm on my second course. These courses are excellent.   The format is similar to programmed learning with small amounts of information with a challenging set of exercises to reinforce the knowledge.

It's one of the calculators I use most. The free version also works fine, but it's got ads. They are not the disturbing popup data-draining kind of ads, so you can give the free version a try before upgrading if you want. Keep up the great work!","Background without grid lines This app is the the best math app I have ever used, it's very simple and easy to use. I really enjoy when I use it. But one thing I don't like about it,  it's the grid lines in the workplace. We really would love to see an option to get the background without these grid lines as soon as possible. The app deserve even 10 stars","9.99/10 would buy again Redifining the basics! New review: the new edit mode is great and supresses the need for keyboard arrows. Also, I just realized you can compute double definite integrals! In my opinion the next step involves improving the 3D grapher. Wishlist: function and programming support with recursion.","Love it! It is great for helping my son understand calculus! Pro tip,  to see the slope of the tangent line at a point,  tap on the point after dragging the x or y axis line to intersect the point you are interested in!","Awesome App for Maths Amazing app for sloving maths question really helpful for me. Highly recommended to every one to use the pro version. Thank you mathlab for making this amazing app. ❤","It has a learning curve to figure out how to set up problems, but it is an excellent app. In fact, I probably should have read the manual like the developer says, so I'm going to go back and raise my review.

They are a new type of innovation laboratory.","comments":[],"version":"1.0","updated":"December 4, 2014","appId":"com.hubculture.app","minInstalls":50,"genre":"Business","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hubculture.app&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.hubculture.app/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.hubculture.app/similar"}]}},{"name":"Responsible Consumption and Production","milestones":[{"description":"Implement the 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production, all countries taking action, with developed countries taking the lead, taking into account the development and capabilities of developing countries","progress":89},{"description":"By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources ","progress":48},{"description":"By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses","progress":74},{"description":"By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the environment","progress":74},{"description":"By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse","progress":4},{"description":"Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle ","progress":95},{"description":"Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities","progress":13},{"description":"By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature ","progress":84},{"description":"Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production ","progress":19},{"description":"Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products","progress":59},{"description":"Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing market distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and phasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully into account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible adverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities","progress":30}],"playstore":{"results":[{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":5000000,"developerEmail":"watchapps@aenetworks.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zf5U3iXN87BXIiQgddr7GQX15TpY_1_JSr5uiXcGdPwvvJ9luvf6loWcdrUSjql15w=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/lgibJKCloAtWhSwiBvrrtgeepTQ3CuaVnG_PrezKgwI0CFXAMu8MYIB4uV0aiXH0XA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/w_JLX18a_7xpqHCKRMubqcN7pRt7saUQFg4t21rJkPknimgKjc-hU4SSx685je1qNgY=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/rHSCJPYX054kRf5X-w_pFbZSjomsT79jMFvZe1swjzHND879fcffs64UnbwfNdTgfM8=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Kcp0uqF4Ev5Jut7A2sytiK_Vo_aUIV4vdWOn20r5ijzSa2H27jsQtjG2-Qt2laQidSjz=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5p3i3m9kBlkn1cjF9-ZdbHax1ObUS9Z7R1XPFhTjutUkqmHeO9ETU9RGMEreLrdVfZA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jZhP90-_1wCPN8HoY99LylSRrAfQw-9F6z425gjpQ_MlzbmFvxi29wuQ9P5D4JXXPw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/_du8Hnri-Mjccm0SA0pV73ClFHYjJHS6To_llQsxXOEvuZzJFgiEZxOvYtMFkfk-wm0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Hl8cP6_am1fqN02S-9w6zIXaakBANC3D_hRGTpH-ZaruVLbmrISQQv3UYIfMdPYA1WrJ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/LbyYUjGhD3wuUg9yOTfNRBQcp7ZHjg_ywkv4kdKWn-pE3VLD2TiuuymwzHBYQO5rKNk=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/CT0Ec7PFxz1vlhE1pcFy8Xory5YA2A7EsB8gW8ktT4OZJFGQlJdHQkYJikEkBeZF46o=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/QGHjPQgL899HugoMbH6i70xlhBIBmpboB5Ued0gdsNG5AcbRKkHLxsYQIj1iadmzGgYC=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ETrNfB2XogiP6ErLlXfaF3dfp8_-nNf3ZeSdz8uh3LzQ5eVbQ6yDW_FQpluqNpC4-dE-=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZxWZv9GqhqZjBzz4lFtIWfHbLNJU2Ucc9B-xvNaufbNSmaLl2_fj-cuM5OjBtNECWw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/_N8lJHpBgsWYJe9b6Yv5r2ZyiQATnAsmOcRJsHVnQhNSED3bq0r9Gpm6VGIN63VX_88=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.1","contentRating":"Teen","descriptionHTML":"Watch Vikings, The Curse of Oak Island, Ancient Aliens &amp; more.

However it is inexcusable that all advertisements are 2 to 3x louder than the show and the app disables volume control during advertisements. So for the love of God deal with volume leveling between advertisers and give me the ability to change volume on demand so I can if you refuse to and this will be a 5 star review really fast.","For the most part this is a great app with good content. But I would really like to see 'live TV' streaming added, as all the other major apps in this class have it. There's no reason this one shouldn't either, as it is already basically a pay-to-play type app!","History has great shows but it takes between 5-15 minutes to load. Then  5 minutes of great quality watching and then a 5-10 pause for ads that never play. It took me 1 hour and 32 minutes to watch a 41 minute episode. Its great if you like to get REM sleep during ad breaks. History is the best on TV but without a doubt the worst mobile app I have ever used.","Galaxy s7 edge. Used to work great. I don't know what yall done in the update but hasn't worked since. I've tried signing in and out off and back and everything in between but nothing. Hate to Uninstaller permanently as I love several shows but perhaps tv is best for some?","It's free! Yes, there are ads, but not at all excessive. I don't mind prostituting my eyeballs a bit for free stuff. I thought I'd be required to login using a cable or satellites account, but I was pleasantly surprised that was not the case. As a comparison, some snobby news sites require a subscription fee - WTF! Who in their right minds would pay for lefty-biased fake news, then endure daily torture sessions as unpleasant as waterboarding; gimme a break.","Why am I seeing 4 commercials for 1 break? Way too many breaks, horribly done. Make an app you can buy that's commercial free. App keeps freezing up and then you're right back to commercials to try and restart your show."],"version":"2.3.2","updated":"January 5, 2017","appId":"com.aetn.history.watch","minInstalls":1000000,"genre":"Entertainment","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aetn.history.watch&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.aetn.history.watch/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.aetn.history.watch/similar"},{"preregister":false,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEcMM5Lu2VE","maxInstalls":1000000,"developerEmail":"android@atlogis.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/TknAjN6Upsea0XtHzbro8SC4hd9Yx1CwF02NBJWiLUZ6WRMj1BVxIYG0LchO-quEoas=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/wkw8caPq4Umo3rvYXLZCz_UZ4CTUbTfwXJ-eOv6rfdtxaApG5jVYPj_I0HKeGodNb7U=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/U07k3OI7pYZ33_1cL5TCgdbu1U-tQpI4LRcTIJCQL5rhdI-rgF6jFAD2dx3CwhQTAfo=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/6e0lgIBxITyC3BCmD_MyI5BzatkcrdoWAn2BaIITY6jM9bLM6in6f4OAdY_7YhjNfW1C=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PBL7XzipyLwRhim8xAzhsDhupG21P_jRKLXZCTRreSvxDy-KLF782MKO6JMROXYBlMKI=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/l8pCKAG4OwZPb-F42rnUl_mVBcQSIY1aWP-OB67Q9K7pHkWBLg2_by1ZIGQ-cOPMcVA=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/nGNYdYSFiIQglEoicjGVO1vcV5EY_DackdyaqOmjWv8bqzXec4ydYgkkXlOP5hWF5jw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/SBLvzMsUqz-om_ptLjpN_762bny2YEtAloqL_SCQNfhUFixYjQGOkrJQhpjDjmtcLw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0QuJ9wqlbyVKBWfngq424d3G6bFxU9F5HPO-fEhMYC3iOGyiQPaOAAL9fvyMcx7es_dW=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/NzzkMt0CzbJ4w-yhNiDVt0muya4iz5p_EQUgA_5Tl3kTLOG90MOehcyLOwRhIPIogqE=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/iLqdOqG3bn7PYE6NKCyxGkVWD_iUNDmeqslzEKDEFG3sCl9pwgiQvnXmfoGOtAwmPek=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jAZD6f0Y5HhPf7lk3Z7LzeoFOQ8uCd5spx0QZuq06W1zFcxetQQ-vYz-VGpZvMNSxM8=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/vrsmzC6fCCeGxq5x3Zk28ZZevTXEP9Qxg8v55nPUlXuFY8LNIGAbXhSbnwU24r7EWrw=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3.3","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Easy to use outdoor navigation app with free access to the best topographic maps and aerial images for the USA.<br><br>*** Please use USGS National Map or OSM if you need most recent maps ***<br><br>Choose between &gt;20 map layers (topos, aerials, sea charts, flight charts, ...)<br><br>Turn your Andoid Phone/Tablet into an outdoor GPS for trips into the backcountry.<br>This app gives you similar mapping options as you might know from Garmin GPS handhelds.<br><br>Main features for outdoor-navigation:<br>&#x2022; Download of map tiles for OFFLINE USAGE (PRO-VERSION ONLY !)<br>&#x2022; Display Real-Time nowCoast Weather Information and NEXRAD Weather Radar<br>&#x2022; Free access to more than 100.000 seamlessly stitched USGS topographic maps - easy to use as browsable map layer<br>&#x2022; Create and edit Waypoints<br>&#x2022; GoTo-Waypoint-Navigation<br>&#x2022; Create and edit Routes (PRO only !)<br>&#x2022; Route-Navigation (Point-to-Point Navigation)<br>&#x2022; Track Recording (with speed, elevation and accuracy profile)<br>&#x2022; Tripmaster with fields for odometer, average speed, bearing, elevation, etc. <br>&#x2022; GPX/KML/KMZ Import/Export<br>&#x2022; Search (placenames, POIs, streets)<br>&#x2022; Customizable datafields in Map View and Tripmaster (e.g. Speed, Distance, Compass, ...)<br>&#x2022; Share Waypoints, Tracks or Routes (via eMail, Dropbox, Facebook, ..)<br>&#x2022; Use coordinates in WGS84, UTM or MGRS/USNG (Military Grid/ US National Grid)<br>&#x2022; Get NWS Weather Forecast<br>&#x2022; Track Replay<br>&#x2022; and many more ...<br><br>Available map layers:<br><br>&#x2022; USGS DRGs: Seamless coverage of topo maps of the USA at Scales 1:250.000, 1:100.000, 1:63.000 and 1:24.000/25.000<br>&#x2022; USGS High Resolution aerial imagery<br>&#x2022; USGS National Map<br>&#x2022; Orthoimagery for conterminous US<br>&#x2022; Google Maps (Satellite images, Road- and Terrain-Map)<br>&#x2022; Bing Maps (Satellite images, Road-Map)<br>&#x2022; Open Street Maps<br>&#x2022; Earth At Night<br>&#x2022; FSTopo Forest Maps<br>&#x2022; NOAA Nautical RNC Charts<br>&#x2022; Public Land Ownership (Padus)<br>&#x2022; Flight Charts<br><br>Available map overlays: <br><br>&#x2022; Hillshading overlay layer for OSM, Google or Bing maps (PRO-VERSION ONLY !)<br>&#x2022; Ridge Weather Radar NWS<br>&#x2022; Wind, Temperature, Pressure<br>&#x2022; Wind Vectors<br>&#x2022; Precipitation Estimate - 1-hr<br>&#x2022; Precipitation Forecast 24h<br>&#x2022; Surface Air Temperature<br>&#x2022; Hazard Warnings<br>&#x2022; Tropical Cyclone Track<br>&#x2022; Wind Vector Forecast 24h<br>&#x2022; Max.

Had a lovely Chinese meal for two (plus leftovers!) last night for £6. The app works fine, two extra features would make it great. 1. Add the option to get an alert when a restaurant on the list goes 'live'. It's disappointing having to check constantly and never seeing restaurants which are listed actually available to buy from. 2. Add the option to rate restaurants.","Great concept, app needs polishing I love this app. Fantastic selection in Central London. If there's no food where you are, check back often as it is expanding very quickly! And don't leave a sour-grapes negative review!! One issue - app works very badly without location enabled: doesn't cache the last searched area on the map so you have to zoom in from world view on the map every time. Also you should be able to filter search results e.g. by collection time. That said the purchase side of the app is clearly very secure and well-designed.","Great, though couple of suggestions Great idea and has worked very smoothly for me. Two ways I think it could be improved are a) to have a rating and review system so restaurants can't get away with giving rubbish stuff. And b) should specify if there is a vegetarian option available..","Needs rating system Terrible customer service. The idea is great, however it only gets three stars due to the difficulties I've had with the app in Paris. Some shop owners don't seem to understand the concept and think it's just another way to sell regular food, instead of cutting down on waste. There needs to be a way to rate shops so that others know which ones do this and which follow the rules.","The concept is great.  However a way to cancel the order would be great. I accidentally ordered something and later figured out that the pick time don't work for me. it's my fault but i could imagine many people doing that, eventually ending up with food wastage. A way to cancel it within certain timeframe would be useful.","Great idea. But hardly any places This will be a great idea when it takes off. But sadly there's none anywhere near Romford (a London Borough). Just a few scattered around central London. Has the potential to be a big app. But currently useless.

The app requires users to scroll through categories. Lack of a barcode scanner to search if an item  has a coupon.  Search tool is unfriendly. A customer must type in name of each item, but then only brings up a list. Time is essential. A shopper should not have to deal with the lack of ease and functionality of this app. It is as if the company does not want coupons to be easily attained while a person shops. I will stick to Target and save money shopping there in less time with their Cartwheel app.","This app had good deals BUT, you can't take advantage of the deals if the system doesn't respond.   For instance, I went to Jewel to shop and get my FREE Noosa yogurt.   I was told that I couldn't get the yogurt because the Mymixx system was down.","I entered my number today and I guess it didn't accept it, because I did not get the coupons taken off for items that I purchased. Disappointed!","The reward program with Shell is total bogus! No idea what my number for the gad station is, points expire.

I would buy this app out of respect and to kill the ads.","I got the point, it is more useful than old version.","So far so good Works very well for me, as a truck driver I get names and addresses for shippers and considers that do not show up. This program has helped me alot not to get lost.","Can't remove dropped pin. Use the app for measuring distance. New version keeps moving the screen back to dropped pin making it hard to use the measuring part of the app. Like the old version much better.","Excellent app - Here are a bunch of suggestions. Make it possible to: - Export all favorite coordinates, and share them - Drop several points to trace routes - Add polygons to mark areas and measure them - Find route with different apps other than Google Maps, i.e.: Waze - View favorites on map - Change pin's icon for favorites - Have several layers, layer for on type of points, layer for another type, etc. - Add password protection  Hmm I can't think of anything else to make this app even better. This features would make this app one of a kind.

Content is good, but the app is horrible. Chromecast only works sometime. And it doesn't resume where you left off from a program, so if you have to stop a program, chances are it won't hook back up to chromcast and you have to slide the little bar back and forth to find where you left off, all while waiting for it to buffer each time.","Good content, bad app I really enjoy the shows offered and wish there were more full episodes or a way to unlock content with cable provider sign in like other apps. My big issue is that this app causes my Samsung phone and tablet to restart randomly. This has happened for the last year on multiple devices and is very irritating and forced me to completely uninstall the Smithsonian app from my phone.","TV Shorts on the Go I'm hooked on Smithsonian content and it's great to have their shorts while I'm out and about.

My only regret is I didn't install something like this years ago. UPDATE: Just done a long drive at night and noticed there was MUCH less glare from my wife's mobile bleaching my night vision from the passenger side, and a hardly visible soft glow from the kids' tablets in the back. Much safer.","So happy to have this app installed now, wish i had it installed before, Amazing work guys.  Looking forward to buying this but interface is little confusing. I was tweaking the settings like display brightness etc without knowing what to do. After i saw its notification tab, i pressed AUTO. Now it works like charm.   Although I still don't know which to opt in - sun, always etc. It would be nice if there is a recommended settings ready to apply,  since many doesn't know which light is good at each times.","It seems so silly but having the hue change to a more red spectrum as the day goes by really reduces the strain on your eyes. I also love that it allows you to dim the light below what your phone does on its own. It also makes the screen a little less enticing so its much easier to make yourself put it down for bed. Great app!","Works great for as long as the app is open, but when you switch to another app the screen returns to it's normal colour temperature. I already had an app that makes sure I can't use any other app: it's called 'switch off phone'.  Edit: Setting the Twilight switch in Settings - Power saving - Protected apps to ON solved the problem. Apparently this is a known issue with Huawei phones. I have therefore  upgraded the rating from one to four stars.","Great app, no ads which I like, and free permission requirements. At first I didn't like it because it asked for location but once you play with the app you realize it's so it can track when the sun will rise where you are to adjust the screen.

I also got very confused about how to use it. I turned on a lot of the \"actions\" that I already do at the moment but the app thinks that this is a saving whereas, it's my baseline. I also don't understand why buying a car is an action if I specified that I don't have one. It looks promising but it needs some refinement and care.","METRIC UNITS!!!  The UI is a bit confusing as well.  Settings - > one option. Seriously? Is that all I can \"set\"?  Logs off randomly, and gives you an error when trying to log back in. Log on with Facebook is successful around 1 times out of 5.  Lots and lots to improve. Otherwise - interesting Idea.","Amazing concept, still rough around the edges Mint connection doesn't work, and hasn't worked for the last three weeks every time I try - please fix this functionality!","Just a reminder that the World doesn't use gallons or miles... I don't find a way to change this.","Good idea but no metric measures Once again a good app made second race by narrow focus on US market.","Good idea, but key features don't work This is a great idea, however I cannot get the badges and metrics to work on Android or the web interface and I see those as some of the key features. There seems to be an error connecting to your servers. Also, the app is trying to do a lot, which makes the interface too complex to navigate.

Good game over all but not worth 4 bucks for unlimited play with what is offered.  Basically you can play once per day smh... rethink this please then maybe I will rate it better or even buy it.  Why make it a free game and you really can't play","Great Game This game it truley fun to play! I don't understand why the rating is so low for it. The graphics are amazing and I like that you can connect with friends and play together. Honestly even though its a great game I wish we didn't have to wait to get more tokens to play. However if you really like the original game board Monopoly, than I suggest you get this app!! Don't judge a game by its rating!! ((;","Not traditional, but fun still Quick yet entertaining version of monopoly. \"Pay-to-play or wait\" aspect is off-putting. I get developer's need to make money, and they haven't used ads here (big plus), but surely there could have been micro-transactions for different tokens, backgrounds, themes, etc. Room for online multi-player if the reaction time is increased. Perhaps some achievements or unlockables? Also, can't see how much money opponents have for my decision making. Look forward to updates","Good but what's the point? Good gameplay. Good graphics. Quicker than actual monopoly to play... However there is no incentive to win... No leader board, no win lose stats, no rewards, no unlockables... Nothing. So who cares if you come second third or fourth (that's just a loss) ... It should have win 25 games and unlock a different board or background or dice... The game would be worth 5 stars if it gave you reason to play.","Format is good, ability to play the game fairly is poor. Several times I've had a card played against me and did not know, so I couldn't use the 'just say no' card I had. Other times I've tried to use a card in the 3 seconds you get to react, but despite pushing the green tick to activate it - did not work. I lost the last game with 3 cards that I tried to use but couldn't...   Oh yeh, I bought 2 other versions of Monopoly on my galaxy 4 that I can't use on my galaxy 6, so I won't be buying this one..","Not really worth it It's nothing like monopoly one u get like 8-9 stamps it over no building no taking over I paid to have unlimited also now I see it's not worth it at all I also was believing u could just play with other plays by joining a game getting ready to start the 3.99 wasn't even worth it neither is this game unless they bring back the old way to win monopoly over all"],"version":"1.2.1","updated":"June 13, 2016","appId":"com.hasbro.monopolyhereandnow","minInstalls":1000000,"genre":"Board","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasbro.monopolyhereandnow&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.hasbro.monopolyhereandnow/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.hasbro.monopolyhereandnow/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":1000,"developerEmail":"apps@climatenetwork.ca","screenshots":["//lh5.ggpht.com/o3Q-k3qS1rxkCUd7-svbCdEw07Cr_-7Q89VGQ5RrBIBDIdoZExUM9etbL-AwIAN5a7s=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/3m-rQ5oZymnQHHPWzBqF7CyoFnDo-qhwXgMCx4lyPFy3u0KdsJc-rOGRcGKW3VwrkA=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/vg_-a3MXLV0U4Tu05t-UyT6agy2C5SaMdCOs-QnSpgxFkktRh3OAhoPrwFf7JsHncp8=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/y52PjqzjHzEUsRIJL6dZ_zNdhLvxOeOcNmfpJVwU9WnRP3Eqv5YzhFWlYm4ee7-Z_zE=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/DXzX-QLlh9C-z9VC_Ce3CQf_oVO7VvcrVWceSdszsR6UoenQskt4R8teUCINNwFOd5E=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/W9Urpsj2hBB1z3eLR5v4a6JcEwBlk0fjSbI9Sp6CYQwXECfBeZyg2pn5pmVE1vwst_s=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.2","contentRating":"Unrated","descriptionHTML":"With this app, the mobile user can stay up-to-date with climate change news, analysis and commentary from Climate Action Network International, including Eco and Fossil of the Day.<br><br>This app is the most convenient way of reading the paperless version of the Eco Newsletter.

Unless Nissan updates the system to  support newer model phones the system will be redundant soon. Galaxy S7 have been around for almost nine months now but are still not supported. Luckily general Bluetooth audio streaming and calls work without using this app. Very limited number of apps in Australia.","Handy gadget After a bit of messing around the app works well with my 15 plate Nissan Juke. I like that the Twitter app reads out posts. I like the search engine and the voice feature is good. I like the send to car bit as it's easy and straight forward. I have knocked a star off as the Facebook app lets it down as it's really limited and you can only see events or check in. Would be nice to read or post to my timeline.","I support concept, but not effectiveness Barring mastery if \"app\" partnerships, I think availability of other streaming services is well deserved. Integration w/ Spotify would be great. Alternatively, creating a controlled stage/sandbox for users to customize their driving experience would be great. NissanConnect is only good for that random person who relies on both iHearRadio and Pandora and TripAdvisor (while I'm driving?)","Dose not work with Samsung s7 2016 brand new Rouge, and Samsung S7 edge you think everything will be great!  When i bought my vehicle they asked me what kind of phone I had, oh no problem said the sales men, you are good.  App started having issues the next day.  When back to deal who kept it for a week and did a complete system update and contacted Nissan corporate. According to Nissan thier app is currently limited and doesn't work on all phones, buyer beware.  Please wait a year or so for updates to car software. Seriously!","Not updated in over a year So much for the additional apps that were coming soon. The app hasn't seen an update in over a year. Application saw support for about two months after release. Connectivity is very spotty, connecting about 1 in 10 times. This is with a Galaxy S6 edge, then an S7 edge and now a Pixel XL. Wife's iPhone 6 plus and 7 plus would rarely work either. Bluetooth works perfectly fine in the car for everything else but the app. Applications work decently well in the car screen when it does actually connect. Rogue  SL","Does not connect I bought a 2014 Sentra in December 2014. My phone was an  LG G3 at the time. The app worked with no problems. I then upgraded to the LG G4 & the app also worked well with that phone even though the Nissan Connect website said the phone wasn't one of the approved ones.  The Sentra was totaled  in an accident in Dec so I got a 2015 Altima in Jan. The app doesn't connect at all now. Why promote something we can't utilize?

The widgets are well thought out and Very convenient. The color and transparency settings allow you to dial it in just the way you like it.. I tend to change screen pictures so really like the ability to adjust font color for better contrast.. The only bugs I've found are the humidity seems to be stuck on 99% and the pressure is stuck on \"null\".. Not a deal breaker though.. All in all excellent app.. just wish those two worked so I could tell if a front is coming..","Very good and unique This app has a very special function - weather by the hour! This is useful for motorcyclists like me who need to know exactly when during the day it's likely to rain. I gave it 4 not 5 stars only because I need to see more hours on the main screen widget, 8 or 10 positions ideally. Right now it displays the current weather + 5 positions for future hours, this is not enough for me but still an excellent app!!!","Very nice! Almost perfect. This has been my favorite weather clock widget for a few years now. However I do have a couple of small requests. You've given us the option to change the clock font size please add the option to change the date font size. Also the widgets for this app need to be optimized for tablets or we need a tablet version. They look kind of stretched on my Galaxy Tab A. Thanks.","Great app - Data Killer Love the app, works great and love the displays. The only drawback is that since recent update kills my data - more then tripled! Also drains my battery quicker. I have adjusted settings but doesn't help save data. Can you fix this with the next update? If not for data killer would give 5 stars.","Easy and Accurate Only installed about four days ago, so far so good. UPDATED 3RD FEB I'm still using this app and I'm still happy with it. My default location has recently been changed, have tried to delete and change it to what it should be, without success. Why? I have uninstalled the app and then reinstalled, then entered my location manually, this has sorted the problem out. Still using the app, would like to have % chance of RAIN.","All okay except...Somehow it changed into me being in Australia even I am in the capital of the Czech republic. No mock apps of course.

After hours of gameplay, I noticed I had come away with a pretty visceral sense of the way nations are desperately vying for economic security, and of the dangers of increasing the average global temperature; even though they are only hinted at in the game, a small gauge ominously clocks the increase as you play. I'm grateful for having this new sense, brilliant.  Don't forget to donate the price of coffee if you enjoyed it 👍","I love how this game forces to make you think about economy against the consequences of the environment. However I feel it is very limiting on economic growth, due to the fact not all income is by product sales of CO² inducing materials. I feel like it is very jarring as a small country with no materials to consume and sell.  The game's mechanics are simple yet a fun time waster. However I feel like that economic growth in this game should a more political degree other than causing wars. Since economy requires trade, it should be a mechanic to help the player and to cut off others from income. It is very weird for the entire world to have an economic grade agrement witheach other.","I think the games is very fun. A few things keepe from giving it a 5 star though: the game goes by very quickly, only time i have ever seen the year 2000 was when i played with unlimited money. The fact that uranium is used so fast is kinda weird as it is gone before i can even realize it was used lol. Other then that its very fun!!!","In all honesty this barely a \"green focused\" game. The early and mid game are how much can you increase productivity in order to get past the $50M threshold required to start having green cities. The end game is wiping out all the more wealthier countries to put yours at the top. So ya, ignoring life is how you win.  Edit: It's a great time waster, I'm just pointing out that your path to saving the environment is to utterly destroy it, which I find amusing."],"version":"2.75","updated":"February 17,

But it cause a little problem i don't know if my Android Phone is the one who has problem or the game. When i trying to use any item that make's light like water purifier, cooker or a torch it crashed the game! Pls fix just in case!","Its like minecraft, but its coo its actually pretty dope. But i saw in the distance a line of items just sitting there, so i wasted like alot of planks to find out it was a glitch, you couldnt pick up the items. Smh but its coo and add some more items and things to do. Im kinda bored","Super easy to learn, the debris doesn't move as fast as everyone is complaining about. Repelling sharks is easy. Takes less than a day to beat. But the images shown for the game are maps you have to pay to get. Otherwise, you just endlessly build a raft. Buggy, glitchy, and laggy every now and then. Gets rather boring. The ads are often, borderline annoying, but not too bad.","The ads that pop up are super annoying and the controls were at first too. I paid to get rid of the ads.  The game itself was fun at first, I love crafting stuff. But I have built everything you can build now im kind of at a standstill. This game needs to be expanded so there is more to build! Pretty decent game, just needs more to it.","It's a good game and has an abundance amount of potential, I've managed to build a few of everything. just wish was more things to craft or for future possibilities it could eventually end up on an island or travel elsewere and get a new set of craftables? N so on, For now maybe increase running speed? It's a touch slow for me as my raft is as long as the range of the items that spawn etc it takes a lil time to get from one end to another in case of shark attack.","Great game so far really addicting. One thing to note i hope the material gets rebalancing soon since the increase or im afraid the player counts gonna drastically decrease"],"version":"1.6.1","updated":"February 15, 2017","appId":"com.pewpaf.raftsimulator","minInstalls":1000000,"genre":"Adventure","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pewpaf.raftsimulator&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.pewpaf.raftsimulator/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.pewpaf.raftsimulator/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":1000000,"developerEmail":"kovalev19831984@gmail.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/T-paFuryt5tPln1_vJfJfqXSl5ksonyXyAyk_RBZ97e4p42jkIJG9r_Wx9QM2jFukQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WNkYojsrCdYZXBRZ22Yp6-JbYcXraTId9JrVAEdbHaeHfDTkGvUyq6j67Z4BTJVGnoA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/RxZL8VN4Gt1UZqgl-hhExKG0PyIqgOSipdV87EOeJdqUYK1R1FrGHgAihc9uOWy2VM4=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/SPB5tSNslfO81Kh3-plPq2igcpj0He6xa_D_XDcG3ccEFxBRy3tI5OfAcQhavzwTdw0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/eZqbhktYdDuUnTcLb8TK4zgkVfrt0PSMR0Hslrf2TMhP97dnwcjPuBGInGy9Fsy2iUXm=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Z4HyY-3OOXPCcCn1oUV4KRHRJj58_Yobp4DtBsntmEwLzuqWsDCGEuXXX6W713UMyA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/xySHAI1dIYZm6SRIGLHQ1dMTafKEKxMTqzBmpLXYcwndW0WJmhg3An_skVqgwi0KRWI=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/SG6jrpp3K3k8HMou-Mp5-MA9NHEMZA3DbxaaioxASD4BZI8-1SALRjynDD_k_971yk4=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mZo7d4MBiMQhaZf9kzlezFDqtwvbam73V3CdOshDf1C5L5CtYKbU71WeAocjm6Jn_Q=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/MEO2k2xvk8rpEokFAuMbfQgOQzZau6-tsNKdOlCD4EZ5OhR4G_EmgZ6KYDrPxmASUA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/QvHzbB8ea2DgmMyFOaDIqsR6KiujwXVLj_Uf-VuFM3FGtnXjfm1pgbs4sFM8kqD-Rw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/RWakYQOf35TLTjq9fJyBNW4OOnrfd_UDwfrU28-wnIi57FXdSsXFn0LNdcePl8I9tjlf=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/6p7Tqr9vj5fgAzcRlqF_o0fjN9D88M4J1uODYp9z8VV-XaGXeJpWLmTbJSaqImVGgMjB=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/De3CltfJC-oU_94c2doULjd5665ZwUdtzwLcppstEy9zQa_W-5srqjo85EbjjW1dIpk=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NI6Z86bsEOaKL-aaITLcx9I6yquxU3OahLeuG2_Nuv66Fx3C7BXrXod-DRjxoghotg=h310"],"androidVersion":"3.0","contentRating":"Everyone 10+","descriptionHTML":"<b>Tired of a usual island survival simulators?

The whole thing is really good, but it runs too slowly on a 4core, 1GB RAM tablet, where many 3D games run fine, even with bloom.  Please add graphics details options and try to optimize the game, make it faster.  Also, the pink stones or whatever they are look really silly and ruin the immersion effect.  Stone must look like stone, though may look somewhat more special so that I know that I can 'pick it up'.  Also, I did not find any other material than 'fiber', no stone or metal.  On the map my heading must be shown - the direction that I'm facing/going.  A compass is needed on the HUD, and better yet, make a translucent map on the HUD, small or full screen when needed.  Until then, I can't say any more, will be looking at this in the future. Thanks.","Fantasic game Love this game dont get why it hasn't got a higher rating id like to see some stuff added but the game is very nice one hint watch free adds for credits before you leave the base then you can craft a wepon to defend yourself sharks in water lol id like to see more fish and more things to do and maby be a little easier to level up and alot more options for building stuff other than that grate game love it","Love hate I don't know what everybody is talking about it doesn't take but one minute to download the graphics are great and what do you mean not like the real subnautica this game is it's on the game and not based off of subnautica unless you can find and actually show me some evidence I don't believe any of you","It's a great underwater survival game idea.

Most wallpapers are too busy/intricate and make it difficult to see icons and their labels.  I use this wallpaper on my Ugoos UT3S Android device connected to an LED TV.  It scales beautifully on the TV screen.  The subtle animation LOOKS GREAT.   If only there were sharks with frickin’ lasers that would randomly swim by…. Just kidding.  It is great AS IS.   Thank you.","Awesome Awesome light on RAM live wallpaper. By the way, people are so silly that they don't know how to open a live wallpaper and are giving low ratings. I would like to advise such people to long press on their home screen, select wallpaper and then live wallpapers. JUST PLEASE DON'T PROVIDE AN APP A RATING THAT IT DOESN'T DESERVE.","This is one sweet wallpaper. I haven't had it installed long enough to know what it does to battery levels, but it's certainly beautiful.   I'd like to see two things: 1. Higher lateral parallax further back in the 3D scene when swiping between screens. 2. Maybe red, green, yellow and purple color alternatives.","The absolute best I had this on my galaxy s4 mini and it was perfect. Calming, pretty, doesnt clash with app icons,and you can set it to your own wave preferences! Now that I've finally upgraded to the s7 this was the first app I re-downloaded! Looks even better on my new phone! As a stressed out, ocean obsessed marine bio student this is the perfect live wallpaper for me.","Amazing and breathtaking on 1080p TV Got this on my TV using MK908V, looks incredible. Please please add an option with some realistic fish! And to all the idiots who say they can't open it, do a google search on how to apply a live wallpaper!!!! Not fair on the dev to give a 1 star rating just because you don't know how to apply it!!!","Congrats Designers!!!! ♥★ You (the designer of the app) is the TOP #1 best seller in my opinion! Just so you know, I am really Burrock Obama.  I disguised my name as, \"Emily Moore.\" I know this feels wierd for me but if you would like to chat please call me by my last name, Obama.

After my new Koi fish phone case arrived I decided it was the perfect wallpaper to match my case.  I fell in love with watching the different fish swim across my screen and feeding them. I don't normally buy apps, but for this wallpaper I've decided to make an exception. This will be the first app I have ever purchased and I feel every penny is worth it. Developers keep these wallpapers coming.","Very nice Really nice view on my Samsung Tab Pro .  When running it responses to a screen touch with ripples in the water and the fish movement responds too.  On my tablet I start it as an app when ever I want.  The other apps I download want to be setup as wallpaper, I am concerned that would slow down everything else.  Don't know if that is a valid concern.","BEST & MOST BEAUTIFUL Live Wallpaper ever! I had the free version on my Samsung Infuse many years ago, and loved it; there's nothing that conpares, as far as live wallpapers go.  I later tried to install it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2, without success. I just found the free version again yesterday and installed it on my Galaxy Note 4, it's absolutely gorgeous! The full/paid version allows for great customization! Thanks for this beautiful wallpaper!","Old but brilliant Live Wallpaper The Koi Fish Live Wallpaper is an awesome live wallpaper. Unlike many other free live wallpapers out there this one goes quite easy on the battery, so you don't have to worry about  sacrificing battery life for great visuals. The only negative thing I can say about the free version is that the amount of fish, background etc. Can't be customized at all, but it would be nit picking as it's a free version. Two thumbs up. Test Device: LG Nexus 5","Definitely worth the upgrade Just over a dollar for all these amazing fish and backgrounds and so many options! I recommend even if you can't get the upgrade though you really should. 10 out of 10 fish flakes. People, its a dollar! If you want to customize it, spend a buck! They need money to make things like this!","Love this, but I tried to buy the full version, and VERY WORRINGLY, I had to enter my card details 4 times.  You now have my personal details, but I cant complete the purchase, it keeps asking me for my google password, which I have forgotten, and the questions they are asking are too intense!  Tried 4 times to purchase the full app, so am now rushing to my bank account to see if I've been charged 4 times,  Not happy at all."],"version":"1.9","updated":"June 23, 2014","appId":"fishnoodle.koipond_free","minInstalls":50000000,"genre":"Personalization","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fishnoodle.koipond_free&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/fishnoodle.koipond_free/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/fishnoodle.koipond_free/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":500000,"developerEmail":"help@navionics.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ud1gowDUpaSTuqby0ATKSB-8OxXaKm0PXKzpPv6tMfcn7aGrrXcGAyA80AI4bRcS-A=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/T3iXUWfFhTIpMr4jD-vqrja6Uav1YmJO83OM5mQHrSNBtbLXYot4zptN8GT62IC_524=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/cEr8fLlJIkQc2Aqg3CTohIfCPQIA1-w5JR2tOZcvx0b6c2jSAO6w_f51Xe5FWva-Smwy=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/bvIMFfef22eFzL0TV6KIlsX7l8iYhhTatwaAiLUTE76XwDiIm_UXk4FaYPStbkAL9g=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/3EscgT6ci1dJRSrvOxUOMy8ByYetIa4vVPwjgwW3ruQaLx9Oai9iRHYjxf4Ih6W-AiQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BKI2qhdjAk6rFcQqh5PdchIutLUQO3f85WLmIBVdKliawpbXxfggj-VHFbgJ_zQMwkol=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.0","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"The world&apos;s most popular marine &amp; lakes app!

I would caution anyone on buying this app!","You get for what you pay for?? 😥 I have some issues with uploads at times using this app offline, with a lot of inaccuracies with water depth. I would hope that this app that was bought was going to be better than the trial, I was wrong. Ice fishing or on a boat this app isn't very helpful with the water depth. With the most disappointment of water depth to me. I also dont get a good loadup of offline use on navonics maps when I'm offline. I know navonics don't claim to be accurate spot on but it's not even worth the bang for the buck."],"version":"8.1.1","updated":"February 6, 2017","appId":"it.navionics.singleAppUsa","minInstalls":100000,"genre":"Travel & Local","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.navionics.singleAppUsa&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/it.navionics.singleAppUsa/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/it.navionics.singleAppUsa/similar"},{"preregister":false,"familyGenreId":"FAMILY_BRAINGAMES","video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YcBHQ2fCDE","maxInstalls":5000000,"developerEmail":"support@disneymobile.com","familyGenre":"Brain Games","screenshots":["https://lh4.ggpht.com/qdk31e0E7tZMg-H4GLEhOpGt2WtIoJmK2jqVTaMKMhGsQ0ajKEWggKwPpikKkiLty9U=h310","https://lh5.ggpht.com/W3umyc0j-1rzix2I6r5T0Krm384VFa27uPQTtN4mYdM7iGC1HTfgV22Do1AdV80HZVIS=h310","https://lh5.ggpht.com/AnpTeaTkFucimJvohhC1exk9HS_wsA1gIiS35L5LEmb5TXJPV_rxzALN89H3UL1HrS8=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3.3","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Get the GAME OF THE YEAR award-winning puzzler!<br><br>Help Swampy by guiding water to his broken shower.

The idea was exellent but attrocely bloated with ads, crashed all the times etc...This one is exellent. Better actually than the no 2. Addictive, clever, fun. I play it, my 5 years old loves it..one of a few games made for all members of the family. Bought the full version and cant see the end of the game. So many levels. As said this game is one of the best i have seen in Years!!!.","This game has provided me with countless hours of fun.  It's unique, the artwork and animation are very well done, the physics are very accurate.  I could go on and on.  I purchased the game years ago on my Galaxy S3.  I later got an S4 and now have an S5, and I downloaded it to each phone and finished the game 100% each time.  It's a great game, very fun and challenging at times as well.  You can get stuck on a level for quite a while sometimes.  Definitely worth getting!  Also, here's a helpful tip: pay attention to the names of the levels.  They're often a hint on how to beat them!","Genuinely fun. I heard about this game when it came out, I looked it up and I really didn't think too much about it. So, I never downloaded it myself. Then my son decided he wanted to get it and he's too young to play it by himself so he kept asking me for help on the hard levels. Instantly I was hooked. Is is a cute puzzle game that is genuinely fun to play. I didn't think twice about spending the two bucks on it. I'm hooked and am glad that my son was adventurous enough to discover it.  10/10","It's fun! It need some thinking.. It's pretty challenging but still quite easy to solve.. It had some extra level which is unlockable via collectibles that can be found in game.. It also had.. Err.. Microtransaction that I assume for people who can't wait to unlock the level, it also kinda let you try the different variation of the game mode like \"Allie\",\"Cranky\", and \"Mystery Duck\" which is can be fully  unlocked by purcashing it.","Good game Started off I seen my kid playing the game on my phone, I decided to help her on a level that she asked to help her beat. I then got hooked and helps pass the time when your stuck at  a boring place like dmv or work hahhaha","where's my update? I purchased the game a few months ago. I absolutely love it! I even got Cranky's Story. However, when I try to update it, I couldn't find it in Google Play. It said it's incompatible with my HTC Desire S. I think it's unfair. I paid for it and I can't get an update?

He is counting on you.","It's OK The levels and puzzles are good but this game really isn't worth the download. There are 4 to 5 missions in each chapter and the are really less chapters .In other words you'd finish this game in a day and if you want to play more you have to pay for it. Really this game could have been so much more if they have some kind of in game currency and earned money through advertisements like Crissy road.","This app is stupid Theres only 15 levels,seriously?15 levels only.Do not play this game.Disney is EVIL.They NEVER EVER make free games!!I would give give it a 0 stars.PLZ DO NOT PLAY IT","Makes you want to buy it There aren't that many levels on the free version, but this is a great quality game.

Wish the programmers would have some pride for their games and have respectable ad content.","Liked it but it's a bit dull I totally liked the game, it was smooth, and fun but its boring. The sea creatures were few and it made it boring. Please make an update that has a lot of different sea creatures and I will really love it if you add sea monsters.","I like it, but.. Why does everything I create in my home base disappear, even when I save? I keep having to rebuild everything I've already built.. Not cool. Also needs more ways of getting food then sharks and whales as those are the only real sea creatures.","has potential Love the idea just needs some work , sharks are a little too easy n you should only get abit of meat, if there was a night n day cycle, a few more things to harvest , a very hard sea monster randomly roaming n the only safe place was the home, I'd love that please update n keep on working on this one, oh n alittle faster swim","Not bad It's a good start, controls are a little hard to master but not a big deal.

However I can live without since this live wallpaper is perfect, I have installed even purchased others and nothing did what I wanted like this one does. It runs and looks amazing on my Galaxy Note 2. If it wasn't free I would definitely purchase this one (Big thanks for having no ads!). Thanks for this great live wallpaper app!!!","This is my personal favorite. Not only is it a truly fluid experience, but the creators were thoughtful enough to allow you the option to choose your own background. A treat for my creative sense and a relaxing screen to interact with. *BONUS* NO OVERLY NOSEY PERMISSIONS!","I agree that it needs a crop feature. The image is almost never centered when chosen. The water effect on the other hand was very well made. The icon dissapeared from my home screen and i had to go searching for it. If you could just put a crop feature on it I'd give it 5 stars","Awesome App so far! There is an icon on the home page, but if you delete it, it can be hard to find, so be careful.  Effects are top notch and the #2 graphics setting looks real.  I don't see any battery drain.or performance lag.","Beautiful and simple Can use custom background, no ads (that I saw), and the water flows naturally. I haven't used it long enough to test battery life. So far so good. Thanks for developing a quality app!","Custumization I love this and that it is free.

It syncs up quickly aswell. Everything is pretty acurate and works as it should. I only have 2 little problems. Sometimes, when tracking my sleep, it will say that the first/last part of me sleeping was being awake. How, I don't even know. Also, with the number of floors. I live in a bungalow. If I am not well, but want to keep moving, I can't achieve number of floors, because I don't have any. I don't know how you would fix this, but it's great otherwise.","I'm disabled and often don't feel well. I used to be very active riding my bike 25 Miles a day or walking 6-7 miles a day. I did dance videos or work out videos so this lifestyle is very different. There are 2 major reasons why I like this 1st it helps to see I'm doing something! 2nd on the days I'm not showing even a mile walked I can see I met a goal of water intake which helps with my self-esteem. Also I can go back and say to the doc, hey I wasn't feeling good this day or that because I can see my activity wasn't where it normally was. It's easy to understand. It was easy to sync with my phone. I'm very pleased. One last note I had something very close to this with WW and I loved it but you have to pay to use theirs. If you buy it  it definitely will help whether you are an exercise junky or just trying to improve your mindset.","I would definitely recommend this app as it can tell you what friends have got in their daily steps and can see if you have beaten them or not! It also tells you what your average amount of steps are throughout the week along with calories, sleeping and how many stairs you have gone up! I also like the way everything is set out and it looks great! 👍","Worked great for one month before the calorie tracking section starting freezing the app and it stopped showing my \"in\" calories. The only way i can enter them is the quick add. The other methods cause it to freeze. Then, despite what I add, I says I have eaten zero calories. Other parts of the app work great. Please fix this.","Had my charge hr since Christmas 2015, been fantastic in helping me improve fitness, linked it with My Fitness Pal app, together they are great. HOWEVER, just installed the latest bug fix update and now my charge HR is not found! Keeps saying \"Looking\". I've never had this before. Please fix this.","New dashboard tiles don't update to reflect daily activity as you navigate back to past days.  These tiles only reflect current days activity.  Old dashboard works as expected so just a problem with new dashboard. Makes it useless to track progress towards goals over time.  Once fixed I will update rating.  Also syncing is more tedious and doesn't always work, syncing should be more steady."],"version":"Varies with device","updated":"February 8, 2017","appId":"com.fitbit.FitbitMobile","minInstalls":10000000,"genre":"Health & Fitness","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fitbit.FitbitMobile&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.fitbit.FitbitMobile/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.fitbit.FitbitMobile/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":10000000,"developerEmail":"slkl.kk@hotmail.com","screenshots":["//lh6.ggpht.com/_jzLMs_pdwq1ec7rohSsL0HxA2bdDH5FechKlr1dr5sBz1DK8LSJFXsD0nOqcmpvOCY=h310","//lh3.ggpht.com/6fxUzZFZBqVgqGJNyO7AziOo1YOHWc3VwsU0ZxlBV9b4GnTw_EwcvS6bWiUhYSEDXw=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/_1UO_-eQhwPguLmqs4QlG8MHvBXzjuNyh5TtWESeRLz_xjO26UwmaXrrmVJ_ACOGQzRO=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/duK64C0OBj4bfTB7wyWN8G7V6lY6a02KwAgiu1IkTyx9Dj6Keg-eu6Zvk6gMjLXUCg=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/O8kXo6iP-tA8OXEXbSkaeIn6LbSPZT-OjtJXz8KZoMHh_QI40dm_IhrhTOtyiHk0FL4M=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/2rLE0SxkQUxyH6njdLbcUmNayop_icWxHmrGAt6vm6faYmhQD_5mwi2eWL8WWT4jsHam=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/kFJdioyWrVg48CUAmPsEGrTixIMhbXctIdQIEyvRCSxbrFZuZgyloEpMIK59KhVPf18L=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/aSU4eV5nDPBjeetMY4EK7bI3LEw1eThqYUUWM1U7kQn782yNjBEhlTWSevaCP2Uk4CU=h310","//lh6.ggpht.com/PKc958SmsbQZ6_tqzdadIRfJkpLoRF4soYQCGonL9oAFmH5ZzvS91GoqqHJjo7RTL3kz=h310","//lh5.ggpht.com/WI6Ylz9A_B6L_YVZogLOL7tGnLvTRvU0bxmKIOu85Cd3uxxSbbBYrwbNZjM8g93xd1A=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3.3","contentRating":"Mature 17+","descriptionHTML":"Hot summer has come, angry, snarling, savage Bengal Tiger needs cool.<br><br>So many cute animals live wallpapers design by kkpicture.<br><br>To use: <br>Home - Menu - Wallpapers - Live Wallpapers<br><br>Note: <br>If your wallpaper resets to default after reboot, you will need put the app on phone instead of SD card.<br><br>We&apos;ve to develop more free &amp; great live wallpaper.<br><br>About devices supported:<br>We&apos;ve tested many phones and tablets,Please contact us if your have any problems.","adSupported":false,"histogram":{"1":7096,"2":4034,"3":7019,"4":12071,"5":47297},"free":true,"reviews":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.kklivewallpaper.tiger/reviews","genreId":"PERSONALIZATION","title":"Tiger Live Wallpaper","price":"0","url":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.kklivewallpaper.tiger","offersIAP":false,"androidVersionText":"2.3.3 and up","summary":"Bengal Tiger.","icon":"//lh5.ggpht.com/3N2n3Oq3aaB544bE8m13y9vUs8sWPHkKRiSyTRwJnyxqtIuWeQuw4--mrBxVXljCH3uB=w300","score":4.1,"recentChanges":["v2.3","add Slide effect","v2.1","1.Update Engine SDK.","2.Update Ads SDK.","v2.0","1.add Foggy Glass.","2.Update Engine SDK.","3.Update Ads SDK.","v1.9","1.Update ADs SDK.","v.1.8","1.Now,you can upgrade to Pro to remove ads.","1.6","1.Improve ripple water effects.","2.Bugs fix.","v1.5","1.Add water ripple effect.","2.Bugs fixed.","v1.3","Add Sound.","v1.2","Bug fiexs."],"developer":{"devId":"KKPICTURE","url":"http://localhost:3000/api/developers/KKPICTURE"},"description":"Hot summer has come, angry, snarling, savage Bengal Tiger needs cool.So many cute animals live wallpapers design by kkpicture.To use: Home - Menu - Wallpapers - Live WallpapersNote: If your wallpaper resets to default after reboot, you will need put the app on phone instead of SD card.We've to develop more free & great live wallpaper.About devices supported:We've tested many phones and tablets,Please contact us if your have any problems.","comments":["Amazing Best wallpaper ever it actually moves around well the water dose when you touch it and the tigers change as well best app I have so far","Very amazing This is a very good  live wallpaper app and the pictures of tigers  is stunning","Awsome I think the wallpaper is awsome cause it changes to differant scences and it makes noise","Bit good but it has crazy artificial sounds.

It is very intuitive and has a short learning curve.   Changing water sizes is very quick and  easy and shows different shapes.  I have added two new ones and removed others. You can check hot Weather or Sports to have the app increase the water target .   The weight reporting is great for me, and shows a graph and an Average Weight line.  You can also add or edit previous days.   You can set vibrate and/or tones for reminders, or none at all. Any number of reminders can be set at any time of the day.   The app is fast and very stable. Highly recommended!","Excelente app! The best water remind in my opinion! Simple,  clever, easy to understand,  easy to use. One of the things I really like is when I drink minutes before the alarm goes, the app doesn't remind me again unnecessarily ( like the others water reminders I had before what was annoying). That's why as well this one is my favourite! Thank you for such very useful app! 👍","It's an awesome app, helps me keep my water intake up as  never drank water do to being a pepsiholic for 40 years. Best app I've ever had on my cell phone. Because I drink more water my bowel problems are gone and I'm so happy. Thank you for making this app.","I'm a kidney stoner and have gotten myself in trouble by getting dehydrated and drinking the wrong things *cough Cherry Coke cough*.  This app is easy to use and love that it works so well with Android wear.  It really helps me make sure I'm drinking enough water, and hopefully I will be able to keep the stone at bay.","It used to be my the most frequently used app. I liked the design and idea. But something changed in recent version. It is so sloooooow now. It connects with the server every time I log another cup of water. So frustrating...","Great app! You can easily put pre-set default drink sizes like coffees tea, glass of water, big bottle and so on, you can customise the default drink sizes and if you don't want any notification (like me) because you use it not as remainder but as a drinking counter you can turn them all off and still track your intake, lobe the fact that you can easily modify the daily target with buttons like sport and weather that will add up for you the extra required intake.  Best of all is free! Few ads but thankfully different than most of free apps on android the amount of time ads pop on screen is really limited, I use it a lot and I barely encounter ads.  Great app! Tried other drinking trackers but this is one is above all! I normally don't bother with reviews but they do deserve one as they made a great free app and also they kept the in app ads to a minimum.  Well done!"],"version":"Varies with device","updated":"February 13, 2017","appId":"com.northpark.drinkwater","minInstalls":10000000,"genre":"Health & Fitness","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northpark.drinkwater&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.northpark.drinkwater/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.northpark.drinkwater/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":5000000,"developerEmail":"emili2808@gmail.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/YziOGK25BBkW9Y6ISzoFLiKGM_bW2kdsGD43TdRMkXX8SYQ4vagAERrEutkf30JL14zL=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/M_VycoMqSjD4coZxdqaEGOKiGdrSqfsJ7m0s4xyRZoPOGc2hLgZlLuLGOha4k9nKtA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/9unOQO1N3lBYfie86a8_v-uS9IMCWJMEvDPhWyh2EYSR16d0Fis5Cy7fQBTO-MqVbw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5YbfdxO3TwWCaoNOzVf7wkT9qKFceI1jIL7ilQVu9q8ijKYwU8CjAb-xmpCAY7YbmA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/nHw67qTCGmbcZxPE-b_Q8gJl0ZkJDoT7D9QtE6PVZq65UG0QtBg8NtGD5BUQKQTyAw=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.0","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Explore the depth of the ocean!<br><br>Ocean Live Wallpaper will bathe your screen with fresh water full of magnificent sea creatures!

What a beautiful way to start my day. I have just downloaded the story of life by Sir David Attenborough. His voice equals nature documentaries in my mind, it equals years of growing up and falling in love with forests and mountains, animals and plants! Thank you BBC! For those who don't recognise Sir David, please download the app! For those who do, of course you will download the app because you know what I am talking about!","I'm blown away. This is the first time ever that I've written a review for an app on the Play Store. I'm usually a silent lurker, downloading apps based off of the helpful review of others. But this, this wonderful app has prompted me to type this out. IT IS AMAZING! 10/10 for everything from the clips to it's ease of use, to the design. I LOVE IT. If you are a fan of nature documentaries and want to relive your childhood days watching TV, listening to the informative, soothing voice of Sir David. DOWNLOAD THIS RIGHT NOW. Thank you the makers of this app, and Sir David Attenborough for enriching my life all over again.","Another BBC Triumph How do the BBC do it ?  Attenborough's: Story of Life another excellent app to support another excellent BBC series.  Dylan Thomas: The Road to Milkwood, D-Day's Last Heroes, World War One at Home, 50 Years of Horizon, Life Story the  list goes on.  Content of this quality deserves the highest praise.  Keep up the excellent work I for one will continue to install these apps.","UNBELIEVABLE !! Few apps survive the first 2 mins of scrutiny .. , fewer still deliver at least what low expectations many have after those 2 mins, of the myriad of apps thrown out there. This one is so good it restores hope that it is possible. It looks like a really fitting testament to the work of a truly great naturalist.. superb work Beeb and worth the licence fee.","Everything we believed apps would be This reminds me of when people really tried their hardest to produce well polished apps. No real need to mention the world class content or the inspiring man involved in bringing such knowledge to the world. But one gripe, and it's substantial, is that there is no Chromecast support.

But wish I could zoom out further to be able to see my whole town. My map is getting larger and getting difficult to place bigger objects and plan out where items will look good next to others and surrounding areas of the map. I've been wishing that one thing forever and decided to write this with the hopes that someone would help make it possible. Thanks love the game :)","Super fun. It starts out with not much going on, but then really picks up. They even have it set up that there are ways of earning donuts for free. If you play with patients they seem to give you the cost stuff As gifts fairly often. Addictive game. Has adult humor. If you like time management games this is a good one.plus is odd enough to make you laugh at what choice are there. Like Moe watering down the beer for a challenge that pays you.","I would recommend this app because it has a lot to do with the actual show, like around level 20 (I'm on level 21) you get to build to monorail. You also get to look at other people's Springfields that are ahead of you, and that is really cool. Another cool thing is that you get to build the Squidport and unlock the Sea Captain. The only problem with this app is that some of the things you buy, you have to buy with donuts, and donuts are pretty hard to get.","Don't bother buying donuts - you can get most of the premium characters for free - you just have to play for long enough. This is my favorite Android game. Have been playing for 4 years (never spent any actual monies). Lots of new content and great events. Sometimes hard to keep up with, but that's half of the fun. Constantly introducing new characters, new items, and new ways to get donuts, so don't worry about not being able to get some items immediately. You will get another chance.","Started playing in 6th or so grade with my first phone and stopped after 4 years of not playing and having it sit on an old phone I found it again and the best part is levels for donuts. And unlimited or so levels, I remember when I couldn't get donuts and the level limit was 40 then I came back and in under a week I got 500+ donuts because of unlimited levels. 10/10 this entire game is and every year it changes because the holiday episodes make the game change.","I loved this game. I put so much time AND donuts into this tourist event just to stop receiving pins from friend events right before winning the last prize of act 1. I will not be spending any more donuts or money on this game until these kind of glitches stop. And of course they do nothing to help you if you do ecperiwnce these issues."],"version":"4.25.0","updated":"January 31, 2017","appId":"com.ea.game.simpsons4_na","minInstalls":10000000,"genre":"Casual","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simpsons4_na&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.ea.game.simpsons4_na/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.ea.game.simpsons4_na/similar"},{"preregister":false,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3EMGFtwas8","maxInstalls":50000000,"size":"Varies with device","developerEmail":"support@miniclip.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/OCWorMfXZG8e6ir_0NDxFPNKQ4Qq__gbPgOh7rrwLugomyqm4GfnxEHqYStDhNvTzQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0Af_WuNw42sRqugBF6Gg9d1nq1cIXbVkDkNOd_jGvVZb8K1MXocFG4n1sAgUUXP5r80=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jFMWdNRx7Y4MK1hqEx8MZoNEDM5kmKFCez-f6_XqGycS3_89rPfGv654AiuEub1B8A=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/63mQ20H1WMpyhLxOtKBsdmGnnxDR2F7vjvfu9njfpjYpEMMAAHyYMcAkAzz2DH968Jw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5s7-yhNhexJR3lYSAj5ivv_FAwF25lzwpUJHkrkcvaGoE5bKuNl9EoZkv1MCgt65VjaV=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/I4Sl00XocybtEYpK-eUwQCZQKOqBG-Mqbhci9gzXc37mZCwsGPjBZKZ_vX-lYCL3dw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ghWCL2dyTPaSi_J7ErtbMBFX8Y0Ovlk5VDHCwZRrnSa4L-P_f6kqNAVB9ViYQErN24g=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/whHpuFNkZR3RMROQcTHzgIMh5dmAOfxz5QhiaaxusObdCpZAVWRjPRZWB4puC-AGmfY=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/guQSAWcgFUqGyf_sHff8udXnr6NTyQ_B3nIrsawZ4M0N8Xw-pF9EPsc4j7wxxmP42kU=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/62adoNVeK7fUVNxs2-r8N712-DzMGrcM2Cd9kLyNuXBqWK9DEa6VyYjA6ogRsWpYVw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/P9cHlhiAFsJ2SGzD_VJm0-Bs6SczIErl15iyzDgSV1bNaOCLqGRtl1atFtceKJfLIc0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sT99LM5SwEIGH9kWxP42YxKpZkcgy8eQIOwxJGpWerer2wIPmFh2baWRj1a-PCkVlQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mR4XAqxkr_mhKRod3z6ssC3p84jEF3xplHVORY8Iy0dWVFEtwnpv3aOCSAW245E6jyw=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/vVr9vpakcRLb96wfd9WdFcnU6hzt1UIGkvFS66saG6bhMYzt6QSsMtv4AdqkuV8gcNo=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/HXNW-FXyppqwjYL7StD0FdQHQc8mBKPgqyD0ckCvRoUa4iT-hQ33ydweCsLDPexr1Rs=h310"],"androidVersion":"VARY","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"&#x2022; The World&apos;s #1 cliff diving game - now on your mobile! &#x2022;<br><br>Pull off Frontflips, Backflips &amp; Gainers from high cliffs, rickety platforms, trees, castles, and trampolines!

I use to think it was because I had an old phone but I have a pretty new phone and it still crashes every time I play at some point. It also has soooo many ads, I understand having a few but there has been times were I got 3 ads in less that 30 seconds. They were back to back and it's pretty frustrating to not have a structured ad system.","I was enjoying it until... The game kept crashing to the point where I couldn't even enter the game anymore, it would crash back to my home screen. One other thing, the ads are SO annoying. Sorry, but bombarding me with ads every few minutes is not going to make me want to buy the full game to get rid of them, if anything I'll just uninstall it if it bothers me enough and find a new game.","A few bugs need squashing The zooming feature doesn't work all I see is the background. The light feature also doesn't work you cannot see electricity moving through a circuit. A few background guides also don't appear, outlines of cups or devices I need to fill in simply aren't there.","Ads The ads are to much, how do I get rid of them? I wud pay a dollar to rid of the nasty ads also not the same as it use to be... the colors of heat and cold and electricty flow no longer show up in create mode","Tis a good game 'cept in that once it took away like, all my non basic and some of those to elements. And somtims it used to crash a lot. To prevent (temporarily!) crashing, reinstall, or restart your phone, or delete the sandbox tab.  Alright but definetly not my fave game.","I have tried on 3 different devices on a number of occasions to like this game. But the nonstop crashes and constant ads have made it an awful hassle to play, if it even launches at all.

It's totally ridiculous that you have to buy half of the game. I get that you want to make a profit off this but I'd rather deal with ads and enjoy the full game. I could easily get on PC and play the full game for free. I put a lot of time and effort into maxing out the stats on all 3 of my ducks and now I can't even finish the game? If you fix this issue then I'd happily rate 5☆ but until then I can't recommend this.","I love it Its been so long since the time I last played duck life and you have done it! The game? I won it! Since I got this app, I have been confined to my tab and then I realized it was 9 o clock at night. I dont know what I was thinking though trying to win the tournament with one duck. The second one really got me stuck! Just the sweet mechanics the little features are very cool. I showed all of my friends at school. JAM ON DUCK LIFE!","Love it! But... I love the game and play it constantly but one bug is really bothering me. I have a duck named Cloudy... Cloudy likes duplicating himself when I buy new eggs, therefore deleting the duck I got. This happens when I exit training or battles after buying the duck... Otherwise, amazing game! That's the only reason I don't give 5 stars. I really want it fixed.","Love it but.............No ............I am not Purchasing....Worlds I love it but I am purchasing Worlds! On the computer you can get the whole thing. This is a rip off, but fun! You only get six ducks! If you want to have ducks and you have six you have to sell one and get the one. They have four more of duck life and they are fine but, this one needs to get fixed you I will delete this game! Maybe you should fix this game! Oh wait you only care about the last four. You should fix!","Amazing game until I think this game was so fun and cute until I finished the mountain tournament and then I had to pay for the last 3 worlds?! Like no way! You should just make it free. Also btw the game is a bit laggy. Fix these and ill rate 5 stars, but it was an amazing half of the game. 😉","Why do I have to pay for the second half? I like the game. It's creative, has great graphics, has AWESOME music, and is an overall challenge for me to take on. But the next 3 towns all cost 0.99¢. I don't get it. In the PC version, I didn't have to pay for the rest of the towns whatsoever, but Jeebus, I now have to suffer with paying... outta mom's pocket, since I don't have a debit card to pay it off.

NOW IM SOMMER PUT OFF FROM THAT LETS FARM GAME!! THANK YOU HAYDAY PLAYERS FOR HELPING ME GETTING FURTHER FASTER IN THIS GAME AND FOR SUPPORTING MY FARM SHOP! :-D","Update Notifications need to be updated so it's not making your phone go off at 3 am multiple times to tell you your boat is about to leave when really you have 8 more hours. I have bought things from other farmers recently and the money is gone but the items aren't in my barn. It would be nice if Tom was 10 gems every now and then rather than 15 too but as long as the previous get fixed I will up my rating.","Slow. I've been playing Township for a while and thought I would give this game a try. Everything takes a long time. Not much to do, but wait. You don't make enough money selling items. Township is so much more fun with much more to do. Sorry, but uninstalled this game. Nice try. Would be better if things moved along faster and if there was more to do. If you want a game that you only want to play for two minutes at a time, then this is your game.","Awesome! But.... I really like this game 😁 but the food takes a while to make some I have to wait a while to complete orders 😣 Also we need to use 1 sack of food per animal 😐 it will be better if we can feed 2 or 3 animals with 1 sack of food. Only minor changes should be made but other than that I really like it. I'm a really big fan of supercell I'm a CLASHER! 😂 Thank you guys!","Amazing. Most polished and most well designed farm than any other farming games out there. Works surprisingly well in 2G internet connection. Really mesmerizing! A very important change need to be made is to give a dial format instead of buttons to increase and decrease the amount of money before putting into shop. Clicking from 50 to 200 (suppose) is very irritating.          Keep up. Regards.","Awesome game but... I love hay day but am not a fan of the fact that Tom goes to waste at night and when I'm at work.  As well as the cost of diamonds.  I've definitely have spent a fair share of money on them and it's just too expensive. Do a rewards program or give out free daily diamonds.  It doesn't have to be a lot just something that makes it worth it when you do spend money.  Thanks.  Otherwise fantastic game.

Definitely worth the money and the only issue I have had is it doesn't save my choice to eliminate # of houses and hotels. The graphics are phenomenal. It is so much fun and addicting. Great game...highly recommended. I don't feel the game is rigged and consider it to be like playing in real life. All about luck. I play the majority on medium and some rounds I'd like to walk away, but it's all about rolling the dice and making the right choice. Really is a thumbs up game.","Rigged Monopoly is a great game....unfortunately this app isn't. The AI is completely rigged. I owned an entire side of the board and the computer landed on chance three times in a row. Also the number of times you will land on the one property with a hotel is staggering. Keep in mind this is on very easy. This game will make you want to throw your phone through the wall. The odds of the computer being this \"lucky\" are astronomical small, and yet turn after turn and game after game, that is exactly what happens.","Not rigged- I downloaded this last night. I'm not an \"expert\" Monopoly player but I do know how to play quite well. The game is supposed to be challenging, like a real game. I played it 6 times on medium and beat it every time. If it was actually rigged, that wouldn't happen. My only complaint is that the touch controls are way off during trades, building houses, and entering dollar amounts. I also wish there was a way to un-animate gameplay to make it faster.","A.I. really is to lucky My device plays this game great and I was having a lot of fun until most of the properties were bought. A.I. and I had a good balance and then all of a sudden the A.I. starts making complete circuits of the board not only by landing its own properties but by also landing on the chance and com chest and getting the good payout cards and I on the same two circuits landed on the A.I properties enough to leave me with no houses and everything mortgaged. That's garbage and not fun.","Great!!! Would b better w/online I was so unsure about buying this app, all the negative reviews had me thinking but I like the game so much that I bought it and took the risk. I have had it for a few days now and let me tell you this game is awesome I have no problem what so ever the app is great and out seems like it does seem a little rigged for the computer but they are for sure beatable I have won 95% idk if this people are first time players but if you like monoplay and consider yourself good its a must Great game passes time.!","I wrote a review and email last night that I was having problems downloading this and it would not install and stop at 98% every time I tried to install it. Happy to say it finally downloaded and love it :) If you fixed this for me and help to solve the problem I was having, thank you, I really appreciate it!

Takes too long to progress Good game, but it sucks that gems and coins take forever to accumulate. For example, I need those exotic looking leaf things to pay for storage space so I can store product to gain some money from selling to progress with shops,but can't store and then subsequently sell the items I need to make more money in order to buy homes for more workers? Which also, the small amount of workers you get makes it really hard to finish simple tasks like picking apples.","Uh... Can't seem to find a way to turn off the push notifications. Really sick and tired of hearing notifications go off all stinking night. Would really love to be able to hire another helper for a set amount of time. It's so expensive just spend 5 gems for one simple action. Also, the wait times are a bit ridiculous. I just started the game a couple hours ago and I now have to wait a full 24 hours to get to the next area. It's crazy!","Descent game worth playing. However, it runs constantly in the background of my phone making my battery hot. Also, it takes up way too much time for building! I will not pay 5 -10 dollars just to speed up a building! Enjoyable but very costly in time and money.","Harvest Land Some issues: when purchasing harvest help, you only get the help for the one item, it would be better if you could purchase the help for a period of time, such as 5 minutes so more can be done for the gems spent. The game in general is addictive but the time lines tend to take too long and I'm forced to seek entertainment elsewhere.","Not much instruction, nothing tells you that it takes 24 hours and all your people to cut down one tree, til after you send them there. Maybe as you get to higher levels and you hopefully get more people?  Because otherwise you are screwed, and you have to buy help. For a free game, it sure looks like you are required to spend real cash to get ahead.","The game itself is awesome! but every damn time I touch the screen the 'Get More Gold' board comes up and I almost end up buying gold I don't want. This can happen dozens of times a day, it once almost got me for $150! If I wanted more gold I would tap + . Seriously will delete if that 'Get More Gold' board doesn't buggar off...... . UPDATE: Thankyou captain obvious but I did that, that bored would come up more than a dozen times a minute, everytime I touched my screen. My phones brand new so it's not that.

I dont want to delete this game im enjoying it and having fun. Can you create other ways to get coins I had loads spent them and then stayed with up to 4000. I also recommend next to ,, visit,, button a stop friendship button or something like that so you can stop being friends with them. Can you also expand the amount of pony s your aloud on a coral. Appart from this Its an addictive game. Thanks","5 rating to 1 :( Fun game, very cute characters, was good playing first few missions until it came to social aspect of the game. I went to add friends in the social tab like it says to yet under my social tab its blank. no buttons, no options to click somewhere to add people, no people, no option to connect to other network (facebook,twitter, google ect.)all there was, was my name, what level I am on, and you cant event click that. couldnt progress past that point in game without social capabilities so have to delete app :(","Shorter version of my huge problem list 1. The gender of the ponies changes once a day. 2. The names switch, it gets annoying. 3. The ad is overing my one feeder, It takes 3 times to fill it. 4. It crashes about 3 times before I play. 5. It loads, but then the screen goes completely black. 6. Also, its really hard to breed a new pony. It takes about 6 times to get something decent. 6 problems, Im on the edge of unistalling.","AWESOME I would recommend this game to everybody it's family friendly and it's enjoyable. I had no problems with the game as other people say it crashes a lot. The only time it crashed on me was when somebody cheated and put too many horses in their corral. Everything runs just fine and its a great game.","Messed up! This game is fun, but glitchy and there is an ad covering a part of the screen! Not to mention, the horse race costs 100 coins. I got first place and yet I only got 80 coins! I just LOST 20 coins! And for some reason it's hard to pet the horses. I have to pet it a few times before it actually works! Fix all or most of this and I will rate 5 stars.","Love it. Very addicting. I love this game. I wish it didn't require internet to play it unless you go to your neighbors corrals. I can't even put my phone down because it is so much fun to play. That is why I dread it sometimes when I loose internet connection on my phone. If it was updated to where we can play it without internet I would download it to my tablet also. :-) Can y'all see if maybe it can be updated to not require internet all the time to play Pony Land."],"version":"1.0.28","updated":"August 12, 2015","appId":"com.frismos.ponygame","minInstalls":1000000,"genre":"Casual","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frismos.ponygame&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.frismos.ponygame/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.frismos.ponygame/similar"},{"preregister":false,"familyGenreId":"FAMILY_PRETEND","maxInstalls":100000,"developerEmail":"support@tocaboca.com","familyGenre":"Pretend Play","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/_-T4xyJA2MeBsPo6Q3fo2aQePPaB0-jhKYgqTgBmySWfRd4ZiBbNbvXQbFNYUC2fJiVi=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/DfheKaiTZQgCJd7peQRnxvR2FSEYR5aNu0QxL6f5EYCZ2cQSDu0VbnW3aOKZArE9a8ZR=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NjinoXPbkPtZFqsjaPtphcz498LwvNbnaKCqUnir2KeVnCjQ-0_La-YZOP4-Pv2oGQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BteqmuMqvpN7S94o-OWTiWEUBbG_UWjjMhWKtF2lAHs3trTUoBCP7I9ZB23phaiAsxQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/bBlv2g6J7LlYGiS1yyK79kDbp2oWp949vgFE6G77-lQIySzS6ilWHRZe3ai0d4fxj-M=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/hAx12tnw9s0Tckq10CkRvyxneNc8FX6_OGoxAi-GVzKWepii6viLk8lvPjShale9kjI=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5L4iEHWn4VmQskIVNm6NEnLJx8kzs4r2elDxXuk6yN2z06plizMO_TD26EPPRxIu9IU=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/HidTlNFjp6Baplo-ghY9_UOLvOYlvnsJVqNrXxgXw20era5h-SthjAx26SusLD1mHZnQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/T_aCcZX-n8r6qbBvXQPDNxACVJXe8Idi_lkvaCJbkiQEtpQjLAdFBNH97URve_IKMRY=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zesOx4ioKHEZ0yBfyq4BD2vQsqlo-PO-OL4HzFP15GoIEoSrJAWSu6ix1B8RFo7P8w=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/26iv59UAapGPnFxbwfyC8_zfVKecBOpedjzyVGpHoyCT3QEJ53JsDE04JgJuCNiMUT0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/eQYdpneBNqgCDQJ7Jb9qTUZG9Y8JgOqDiNORtS01KLqHHXtZelZVZdVor4oLVr_lEQ=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/_eLeQOh0uDXuc5tziE5CpQKcHSvRBWJBvKT05uXVXFfK6DlNy5O0LXNuRUDJUKlYMejq=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/8S9YeKcMaPLylmTeQVw3yuBFL-2TLsLYIkBfH0EnY8UKztELJUlBbzruS4XJQ2IpV6s=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jk10-Tkd0rC98pKUzqjMDyVIHj797Y40FD4Sbyyz8brvn1yTEn0VfRdBSt6dbojRljXs=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/vXactaiz6rcO59Dmj2I0bSD2qo2SAl9if0dTnL6li-iu5eNjlJ2vy7hj6noumoqKPXM=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/i2qQXjsBt6iXnLZvC8hjl00VfFD4ITtAyNtw9StQgAszDvVq-SgQx1uFlHXF6jDQnEc=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/gOfyFzUxSX1EOp7f15-hSpG0HQ1ijRrOWT9ODuRuUnXd6PBbt0yQYTY22epWLkNkE_M=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.1","contentRating":"Everyone 10+","descriptionHTML":"Make every day a vacation adventure!

Like I live that you can actually listen to the radio in the background and the hotel idea was so cool! If I were to make this game I would make just regular  houses. Good thinking! I can't believe the people can actually empty the bottles by drinking what is inside them. One question:once you pus something in the garbage can you get it out? But otherwise it's rad! ☺🏫😄 good luck everyone else playing toca vacation!😁","Love it😚😙😘😍 Okay so I am this guy's daughter and I love toca life: vacation! It's so fun to play with but you people that work at designing the game really need to make more rooms in the hotel, make more places to visit and please let us put the characters in cars and I would love if we could push a little button on the car and it would start running and when we want it to stop we could push another little button. Please toca Boca make this and other  suggestions happen!!!!!🙁🙁🙁😢😭","I love it but needs I love the game needs changes because I'm tired of going to the beach and getting people and getting them hotel's you need changes now if not the hole girls and boys will be mad and beg you to update it here's some things I want you to do. 1 make the people get in cars and make a button to stop and make a button to go. 2 make markets and make one side be food drinks and other foods and drinks they need and make another side with the check out place. 3 make the people walk by there self. those are 3 things I want you toca boca to update","I love all of your Toca Life games so far! I would like a Toca Life zoo where you can be a zookeeper or visit the zoo alone or with family and can you add rentable strollers for babies. And can there be all sorts of animals and there can be lots of food like leaves fruit and meat and you can shovel up the poo and can there be baby animals too thanks!","Toca Boca should make it so that you can create your own toca life character to play with, and you can bring that character throughout all of the toca games! The character customization app would be a (free please) seperate app from the others. You can save the character and using a code thing, you can spawn your character in the toca life games. To avoid bugs you should only be allowed up to 5 customized characters in a game at a time. Also, a gallery to display your toca creations","I do love this game but.... I wish all toca boca games were free I know it's only £2.49 but I want all toca games and I only have 2 cuz they can be expensive if u have to pay for 3 kids so me and my brother and sister have a choice of 2 toca games each cuz they r 2 expensive to buy for all 😦 it cost £15 for 2 games each 😔 sadly we can't get any more so please make your games free or a little less expensive like 50p or something😢"],"version":"1.0.2","updated":"September 9, 2016","appId":"com.tocaboca.tocavacation","minInstalls":50000,"genre":"Education","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tocaboca.tocavacation&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.tocaboca.tocavacation/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.tocaboca.tocavacation/similar"},{"preregister":false,"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXvgveTZ87Y","maxInstalls":50000,"developerEmail":"info@guardiansofancora.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CflEm5_ke9TS2g4d_PxNtylgvibvu2Z8ZkKe5NCiDPp9Bs0HjG7UzBuvdqH7VCpw98=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_eKkpJrPpqu8abksKhzrRjShfEMHPeX-7WsSX871X-bFmzRSQlMRnkurAYEHon-Hhhk=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_5uJ52ZDeZXnpZWi1CKqRLjNBZY1VNx9H9BIL6M1ZaFDLBHDpo_d5A0YmIQAoOqPfsl=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5pX0VuSmM3DCoyLK0yNdlZD4zXPabZ9Okh80U0cjAe5VxPqOCe1erEjAZwgzYvT7MA=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/23cbY5btQnblal2nfOtmRRlNU5ULR4bIrKerpxT56HA5L9CQpeepuLvX5DHjf6sZt_cc=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BMMAGQLkJaluoTz80x8yCz4PHTNt_U_616b6EQos4P4pzCHeGKpNhFf5U8-hF_0L1pJz=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/svZlhhCFPWL_HhfrhADNfoYELUDFxidrI_VOFlvl4kl24Aj1wuOdR3qtdjum1jkc5M8K=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/qJW4rn2pNJrLOzzwNCVtC2YOeQ5BgjTn2scawrqrGZqQpd1ULxBw5mige65B8ofSdIM=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/42lQIgnn42I4k4-dMVMelJNKBiNCV-UdBtd9yTLxV7-S4cVL2UIPJ85mYLhpC6JkmHj7=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/7VJCK7MSszs3wgM_D-DX6uQTJngbz8Q16KhZY2VCsHq5WGz07zCTkfs1QodgQ_Y7GHk=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/phnklZiy0MSqjJ3Hhbuqriv3g4B9Rxw1grkt1dUmOpmQsw-B-BkWHtb3Edc6aGIV0t8=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/xlu2OySnrr-SuPhTAg6vOr9MvANfuLQ0VHOkci_SO6ISEq6JDYNImEGdXqZ47lB4G9Q=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/9wEg0VskRF7d9aRZuB-gFffbJjrmDva9U-YRrtcwHB5Ema0vSWR34ul3bTKPghdSZg=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/9oUPDrmlTHCrHWeOlcPR-etL9w8EkBf-Yy5FrgBm0e6pEavDiq9JzMTCg8r_7fMUB2s=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/PMZ0e_e_VZH1pvFGC1MNopEHMPjJvrsB5ypDgRRdTyMfJtE1eNtwh3XpZPywXahx8w=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/GqMu5Ih7ez8qzfuD7aYlOuB6hFZJYZ-TKhzCUuMPgeX9Nhm0zy48vW_T5cvo-5sYiAc=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ee-xuRBWsMZ6Xs9WL7epMFasYj-R8ob94QWRIKpYafZBvrp4qWD7oGPAoA9NKgMAbm8=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NYZ4KpsZl_7SkI9BA8QBwU9mEiirsi4tWCRmSGvwsvKK96DXSPdvNdYjxQj5Zb8clPHd=h310"],"androidVersion":"2.3.3","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Guardians of Ancora is a fun, epic parkour adventure game where players have to run, jump, roll and slide their way through stories of the Bible where they&#x2019;ll meet Jesus and experience the miracles he performed.

Once I manage to get down to the 3 at the bottom the button to lift the platform up doesn't work so I can't get the top 2.

I love that I can customize my avi, but it won't let me use mesh items properly. I love that you can talk to folks. I'm also glad that you added group management to this newest update. But now I notice there is no way to change your name or bio. I have no access to a computer that supports the desktop viewer and there is no way to change them from the SL website either. Other than that, it's awesome. Keep up the good work!","I really like this viewer but paying for the full version really makes me wonder if you guys are going to ever fix the chat issue. When I send a message, it splits the sentence and it puts the punctuation at the beginning then it cuts my sl name in half!","I've had this app for a while, and used to love it. Now it barely works. The only thing I can do now, is chat. Object search takes forever, and crashes the app half the time. 3d view crashes the app. I get logged out every 5 seconds. In-app looks nothing like the pics shown. Mostly white and grey shapes. At least, before it crashes. I've tried adjusting the settings to no end. I still can't get it to work even half way as decent as it used to.","Definitely the best 3D SL viewer so far for android tablets/phones. Neat update on the interface and love that group management! And there are plug-ins for voice call now! Ain't that neat?! Interacting with some objects are ok. This viewer is not meant for building.","I was hesitant to purchase this as I thought there would be no way I could run SL on my phone. I was pleasantly surprised! It looks and functions much better than I expected and is a great tool when you're away from your computer. Nicely done!","THE viewer to use on Android. Some obvious features missing, e.g. slurls in chat aren't supported among other small missing things. But it now has bento support... how cool is that?

This one is by far my favourite. I enjoy the interactive things in this game and how there aren't any rules. Things I can suggest for next update: A school, with a school bus to take you there, a hospital, with an ambulance and cool things to do there, and finally, a pet store. Maybe with mice and gerbils and little cages to buy and leashes for your dogs and things like that. Maybe add an adoption centre in the pet store for cats and dogs? Still super fun :)","Kids love this!!! All of my kids love the games you guys make. This is the first app I have ever bought for my kids and it was worth every penny and then some! It is for younger kids 3-6. They even have named some of the little people. They play all the other apps that you have that are free and love them too! I will probly end up buying a few more im excited to see what you come up with next! They have been begging me to buy the toca city. I am thinking about it.","Exciting and provides hours of fun! This game I have downloaded on almost every single device I have. Its really fun! This game is kinda like a doll house. Its got all different characters (dolls) that you can choose to play with. You can do almost anything. From swimming in a lake to making farty noises on the potty. This game is probably the best one Toca Boca has ever made! I rate it 5 stars for those reasons!","Love it but needs more stuff I loved this game!!! But after playing for a couple of hours I ran out of things to do. A mall would be appreciated and there is a schoolbag and books but no school. I loved this game so plz plz add more stuff!!! I also find it hard to cook stuff as in mixing tofu and tortilla or something. It is waaaay easier to cook on toca life city.","Awesome! I love this app! I just have one complaint, you can't pour the dog or cat food into their bowls. You can just feed them the bag, but that looks really weird. One suggestion could be to be able to pour the food into the bowl like water, so it looks like there is dog or cat food in the bowl. And when you take the bowl to the animal they eat it like drinking water. one last thing-- ADD TOCA CITY LIFE ON GOOGLE PLAY!!!!!!! BECAUSE IT IS ON I TUNES!!! 😉😉 I love you toca Boca!!","Needs improvement I know this has more than likely been heard over one thousand times but there is a reason for it! Kids get bored of the same things so we need more places to go in,maybe minigames to earn new buildings? So everyone has something to do!

المملكة المغربية، وفاء لاختيارها الذي لا رجعة فيه، في بناء دولة ديمقراطية يسودها الحق والقانون، تواصل إقامة مؤسسات دولة حديثة، مرتكزاتها المشاركة والتعددية والحكامة الجيدة، وإرساء دعائم مجتمع متضامن، يتمتع فيه الجميع بالأمن والحرية والكرامة والمساواة، وتكافؤ الفرص، والعدالة الاجتماعية، ومقومات العيش الكريم، في نطاق التلازم بين حقوق وواجبات المواطنة. المملكة المغربية دولة إسلامية ذات سيادة كاملة، متشبثة بوحدتها الوطنية والترابية، وبصيانة تلاحم مقومات هويتها الوطنية، الموحدة بانصهار كل مكوناتها، العربية - الإسلامية، والأمازيغية، والصحراوية الحسانية، والغنية بروافدها الإفريقية والأندلسية والعبرية والمتوسطية. كما أن الهوية المغربية تتميز بتبوئ الدين الإسلامي مكانة الصدارة فيها، وذلك في ظل تشبث الشعب المغربي بقيم الانفتاح والاعتدال والتسامح والحوار، والتفاهم المتبادل بين الثقافات والحضارات الإنسانية جمعاء. وإدراكا منها لضرورة إدراج عملها في إطار المنظمات الدولية، فإن المملكة المغربية، العضو العامل النشيط في هذه المنظمات، تتعهد بالتزام ما تقتضيه مواثيقها، من مبادئ وحقوق وواجبات، وتؤكد تشبثها بحقوق الإنسان، كما هي متعارف عليها عالميا. كما تؤكد عزمها على مواصلة العمل للمحافظة على السلام والأمن في العالم. وتأسيسا على هذه القيم والمبادئ الثابتة، وعلى إرادتها القوية في ترسيخ روابط الإخاء والصداقة والتعاون والتضامن والشراكة البناءة، وتحقيق التقدم المشترك، فإن المملكة المغربية، الدولة الموحدة، ذات السيادة الكاملة، المنتمية إلى المغرب الكبير، تؤكد وتلتزم بما يلي : - العمل على بناء الاتحاد المغاربي، كخيار استراتيجي ؛ - تعميق أواصر الانتماء إلى الأمة العربية والإسلامية، وتوطيد وشائج الأخوة والتضامن مع شعوبها الشقيقة ؛ - تقوية علاقات التعاون والتضامن مع الشعوب والبلدان الإفريقية، ولاسيما مع بلدان الساحل والصحراء ؛ - تعزيز روابط التعاون والتقارب والشراكة مع بلدان الجوار الأورو- متوسطي؛ - توسيع وتنويع علاقات الصداقة، والمبادلات الإنسانية والاقتصادية، والعلمية والتقنية، والثقافية مع كل بلدان العالم ؛ - تقوية التعاون جنوب-جنوب ؛ - حماية منظومتي حقوق الإنسان والقانون الدولي الإنساني والنهوض بهما، والإسهام في تطويرهما ؛ مع مراعاة الطابع الكوني لتلك الحقوق، وعدم قابليتها للتجزيء ؛ - حظر ومكافحة كل أشكال التمييز، بسبب الجنس أو اللون أو المعتقد أو الثقافة أو الانتماء الاجتماعي أو الجهوي أو اللغة أو الإعاقة أو أي وضع شخصي، مهما كان؛ - جعل الاتفاقيات الدولية، كما صادق عليها المغرب، وفي نطاق أحكام الدستور، وقوانين المملكة، وهويتها الوطنية الراسخة، تسمو، فور نشرها، على التشريعات الوطنية، والعمل على ملاءمة هذه التشريعات، مع ما تتطلبه تلك المصادقة.

First off the game is great, I love the city vs city action. I played 2hrs straight. The only downside is that when the winds are 23+MPH I can do a perfectly horizontal line against the wind and it still not be enough without the wind blowing the ball past the goalpost or it falling short. and yes, the ads are annoying too. Make power ups like lifelines each game. 1 of each power up per game. Make a decision please. Power up microtransactions OR ads during gameplay.","Awesome The game is awesome, but the only thing I don't like is what you have to do to get more footballs. If you could make it to where you don't have to add/invite people to gain footballs but instead make it based on achievements that would be better. Alot of people may not have social media or alot of people they could send invites to that would accept it. Just a thought.","This is my fav Flick game! Very fun at challenging you as the difficulty progresses the more you make FG. I wish my city(L.A.)was represented in the game & I love the inclusion of College Teams but loath the $2.99 fee in order to unlock them. The game itself & controls are well done... I just wish there was a little more to the game!(4/5).","Love it I wish there was a game type which gave you a target to hit within the posts. Other than that I'm addicted lol. Also for those complaining about the wind, you have to keep your thumb or finger on the screen for the follow through","So realistic, all the way down to Oakland getting cheated Is that how it works?  Grinding it out all evening to get the win for your city just so a hacker can jump on and instantly add 30 thousand points to the opposing city?  Nice... I hate to give only 2 stars because I love the game play..  But I'm just so aggravated by cheaters I can't give anymore.  It's bullshit,  fix your security..","Good, but Awesome app, but wish they would let you pick/buy all 66 colleges instead of only 31 (if all 66 get added to be available to buy I'll give it 5 stars, but until then 4 stars) Update, but still same colleges available"],"version":"1.3","updated":"December 6, 2015","appId":"com.pikpok.fkfg2.play","minInstalls":500000,"genre":"Sports","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikpok.fkfg2.play&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.pikpok.fkfg2.play/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/com.pikpok.fkfg2.play/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":500,"developerEmail":"support@crowdcompass.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/BHYD2bsigfFQVwHU0D7jg5TsSplBCH15x9oCIHf8H8Tc983Z3jyPzmIuDXpduwoIYV0q=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zTkW_iztrJwr5eKIL8qf1z1kYxdPadp42mZODKqQtYdqo5eosF7fdWnNuodk1L045Kc=h310"],"androidVersion":"4.1","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"Extra Space Storage is the second largest operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. Since we were founded in 1977, we have taken the storage industry by storm.

Easy to use. Still I can't use this and will uninstall it because my wife and I need about 18 general envelopes and 3 accounts, and paying for a monthly fee is not part of our envelope plan, will consider for a one off payment. 10 envelopes doesn't help anyway. This app almost replace my Excel and my current app. I'll come back when there's a new plan","Very helpful! I found this app to be an excellent tool to help me get into better spending and budgeting habits. Since installing this app, I have not had any trouble with overspending or missing due dates. I highly recommend, especially for teenagers/young adults who are first getting out on their own. My only advice is that you need to be diligent in recording your purchases in a timely manner or it will throw your entire budget until it's corrected.","Easier than I thought. Very easy to set up and also to modify.  First time I tried it I was making it too complicated.  Start first just setting up the envelopes with your budget numbers and then just put in your transactions as they occur.  It will feel great to see instantly if you are on track.  No need to link with your real accounts.  If you do want to connect them, do it a little later when you really are comfortable with the system.","Very few updates and no new features I really appreciate this app. But it is seldom updated. What keeps me looking at other apps is the lack of updates and new features. Eg I'd like the option to merge envelopes, analyze my spending and much more that can be done with huge data I've invested over the passing year.","Love it I've been using this app/website for several years now. And I love it. It helps me stay accountable to my budget. I keep track of my cc debt (that I'm paying down)... The only thing I wish I could do is reconcile my accounts on the phone. Currently (as far as I can figure out) I can only do it online.                 Update: 11/30/2016 Still loving this app/program. Use it daily. Helps me see where my spending issues are.","Missing payee management App is pretty good. However, life would be easier if payees could be managed better. I would like an option to view my entire list of payees and be able to edit them. For example, if I ended up with two payees Mcdonalds and Mcdonald's, I would like to open a payee list, edit one (to make them merge) and the change to be applied to all transactions under that payee. Editing payees is painful since you have to edit every transaction in your history for the payee to make the change stick.

I have 2 minor issues: can't change my main profile pic and unable to correct messages with links in them. Other than that is great and I enjoy using it a lot! FYI: you will always run into someone looking to flirt on all language exchange apps. Don't let that deter you from using them. Be cautious and block the creepers.","Staff whose have to help you if you face with a problem while using app is not working with this company. I had log in error with gmail and probably I explained the problem 3 or 4 times and when app kick me off from my account and cant login again I sent an email also fb message. They wanted from me to explain problem again however I explained the problem many times. However if the behaviour of staff and helping policy change to more care for customers this app will be one of the best in future. I like it but because of these issues I am almost going to uninstall it soon.","The app is well designed! Also there are lots of tools to use and many people to contact :) We can use massages, calls, video calls, etc. The only reason I remove a star is because there is people who only want to date. They even if I'm a boy and they're boys, they never answer as they only want to talk to girls. What is worst, there are boys with pictures almost naked. The same with some girls.","First I had to wait a month to get my account. Now I've met so many great people unlike hellotalk. The only reason why I'm not giving this app a five star is because; because I can't change my phone number on the account and will have to get a new one losing all my reviews, followers and chats. And they wouldn't let me sign up with email or my preferred phone number in the first place. And now I've just found out that it starts erasing old messages. I'm really mad! I like to go over corrections from last week.","I'm sure it's a great app, but I wouldn't know because I have still not been approved! What's up with that?! Not worth the download. Literally a waste of space. Sorry, but you need to fix the problem!","I've tried a few different language exchange apps and this one is my favorite.  You have to answer a few short, easy questions before you're accepted in, which I appreciate.  On other apps I've been flooded with messages and requests, some of which weren't appropriate, so I think those questions help take care of that and helps weed out anyone who is there for the wrong reasons.  I love the format, and the people I've met have been nice and friendly.  No complaints yet.  Update: So as I've used the app more and more, the one complaint I have is about the references.  I like that you can only leave one after having spoken to someone for a certain period of time, but the way it works seems pretty random to me.  Sometimes I can leave people references after only having chatted with them for a bit, but the other day I was unable to leave someone a reference even after we had a video chat."],"updated":"February 16, 2017","appId":"net.tandem","minInstalls":100000,"genre":"Education","playstoreUrl":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.tandem&hl=en&gl=us","permissions":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/net.tandem/permissions","similar":"http://localhost:3000/api/apps/net.tandem/similar"},{"preregister":false,"maxInstalls":5000000,"developerEmail":"support@isotimer.com","screenshots":["//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sJ2DtGCBgKWHVQ93n8ymOhewjnIUyQO0ZzCUlPCrf1h4tqU2ewBcpD_avSlL_Grr0t0=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/dAJEjBktI96Q6ybGSXHgCidRXFj1V_0ijE9WlDe02B1KjdY8YHnc2Q9dKuh2syHRlSE=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/_9x6V6NejRSGLCrB3LRsK_wuup1o5mnrv4IDu0_RtBqhodhIsKawHed5Ch_4r__2197N=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/2b4CzyT8cQewgpONbR3_jRHHF4zcinIMwBxW-vkykGuaeM_SCuBOl4pnz8jKIlR5pu8=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Z28kQEt16nuGugYCQneinB_2I_NA9eSNpN9Z3h6n9gTEUggeYfzrrpK6FkShzW3l1g=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/s7OAc3s8DJsKoqyvNBT5paZaRjwRfDYA-H_v8fo_QL85zl05YKO28juQBa_8gne1kXDV=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e5heXKhKG1lQLzQAvIL70jv74SAvsejO0eA9EV3akiXg07NIsmsFby4d-DOs88dO5Q=h310","//lh4.ggpht.com/Vbn-7RV4C1twm4YcjfvDCfOT3Hne2WH78hwwggT_HOLl67wzeOZtXkzM9kDWt88bqlrK=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/bAbY3DKS4tb_cRAZ1uPBU7lDqltI1Wiv-60d3GmRnvB4JIt0FhCW1Ak8_CE7MikncbQ1=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/DOhSBj2XDpCH7vaVGgPMbmEpOeDCYlqZeV5nCNRB7gzifhXS4KMtgHY5I8-iNDlBL0DU=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/W6-j2espmUvrgMUc2yxcbgMjYZ0VyfqkLpb-h8Ws78hRRPm_DrXNndEtes_Opgelj70=h310","//lh3.googleusercontent.com/dyhpD7W1sL2_6WdyDZr-AI7FzDkWsu07uhRw9bveCKfchxpn9_mp-XhnfkYDMi8TqQ=h310"],"androidVersion":"3.0","contentRating":"Everyone","descriptionHTML":"<b>The ultimate personal organizer!</b><br><br>&#x2022;

I did at first.  But it's extremely buggy and has now deleted everything TWICE.  The repeat event feature doesn't work and if you edit occurrences the entire series of events disappears.  Everything you put in randomly disappears.  It does the opposite of what a schedule calender is made for: It wastes your valuable time and creates chaos.  I'd give negative stars if I could.  So much time wasted on this ap.","What a mess. I painstakingly added events with repeats no reminders only to find they weren't getting repeated but WERE getting reminded. I am not an idiot i did it correctly but something glitched regularly. I gave it a second chance and After re-doing the events I'd find the event i had corrected previously was again missing or being repeated for longer than my set \"end\" date. For an app you need to rely on it is extremely forgetful and just plain incorrect.","Lost all my appointments in last two weeks. It just disappears after reopening again. I been using this app for a year now.","I really like this app. It has many tools that I find unique. I upgraded because I feel like these tools can be extremely useful. Would like it to be a little more personalizable.","I loved this calendar for 2 years, but now events I have entered are disappearing. I can't afford to lose that information! --and I can't find a \"help\" contact for Isotimer's To-Do Calendar, which is the real problem. This may be related to changing my phone (I also can't get my account of old lists to download to my phone). Some events like birthdays are recoverable, but some new additions disappear.","Love this app and all its features-very well designed. One suggestion to make it 5 stars-need option to be able to see task list(s) on whole right side of calendar instead of having to rotate screen for this and that makes list shorter like below calendar, and instead of having to switch screen views, would improve  functionality on side.

And looney tunes have been my favorite since I was a little girl. Seriously, I had my room decorated with it when I was 17 lol. I just read someone's comment that says the game is ruined on level 45 by some sort of tripple challenge. I hope they fix it by the time I get there cause I really love this game. Try it, you'll love it too!","ADDICTIVE!😍 My only favorite game ever! Number 1 fan! 💖😁 I've been playing it for a year, and will never quit!✌ I'm on episode 48 (level: 706 to 720). Can't wait for the next one!😍","I have been playing this game for almost 2 years and loved it so much that I got the whole family to play the game.  Now the game has gone down the tubes with the addition of Triple Challenge beginning in Level 45. I have been trying for 1 month to get past the new Triple Challenge and the game It has been impossible to play.  Road Runner what seems 3 time faster, it's 3 time longer and the obstacles are way too close together to finish the level. I've given up on the game and can no longer play it.  My family feels the same way and they will be dropping the game. You really destroyed a great game!","Love this game but it's still way too glitchy and messes you up as you play. I've closed all other open apps and it doesn't help at all. I had this before and left the game came back way later and it's the same. Please fix so it can be enjoyable.","I have problem at level 715. How to collect the looney card? I know where it is, but couldn't grab it somehow.
